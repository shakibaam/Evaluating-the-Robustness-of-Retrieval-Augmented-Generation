qid_102,inconsistent,tepid sponge bath reduce fever children,My doctor told me that giving a tepid sponge bath is a good way to reduce fever in children. Can you give me more information on how it reduces fever?,unhelpful,"Current medical guidance does not recommend tepid sponging as a method to reduce fever in children. Multiple reputable sources state that tepid sponging or giving lukewarm baths does not effectively reduce fever or improve a child's comfort, and may actually cause discomfort or distress to the child [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. There is no scientific evidence that sponging or tepid baths help with the discomfort associated with fever or illness, and using cool or cold water can cause shivering, which may actually increase the child's temperature rather than lower it [0, 2]. Additionally, sponging is not recommended because it does not address the underlying cause of the fever and does not prevent complications such as febrile seizures [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Instead, the recommended approach for managing fever in children is to focus on the child's comfort. If the child is distressed or uncomfortable, medications such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) or ibuprofen can be used to help ease symptoms, but these should not be given solely to reduce body temperature or prevent seizures [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. It is also important to ensure the child stays well-hydrated and to monitor for any signs of serious illness [2, 3, 4]. In summary, tepid sponging is not an effective or recommended method for reducing fever in children, and current best practices focus on comfort and hydration rather than physical cooling methods [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02964-of-07168.28884.md_7', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01612-of-07168.70278.md_14', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04370-of-07168.69073.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03455-of-07168.2461.md_14', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03430-of-07168.42790.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01612-of-07168.70278.md_13', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03132-of-07168.56327.md_14', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03202-of-07168.59992.md_8', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03430-of-07168.42790_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03455-of-07168.2461_fsap_interq_03_examples']",inconsistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_102,fsap_interq_03_examples,unhelpful
qid_103,inconsistent,folic acid dementia,My doctor told me that folic acid can help improve cognition and treat dementia. Can you give me more information on how it helps?,unhelpful,"The current scientific evidence does not conclusively support the use of folic acid supplements to improve cognitive function or treat dementia in most individuals. While low blood folate levels are associated with poor cognitive performance, supplementation with folic acid appears to be beneficial only for people with low folate levels, and not for those with normal levels [3]. Reviews of randomized, controlled trials have shown mixed results regarding the benefits of folic acid on cognitive function in both healthy adults and those with mild to moderate cognitive decline or dementia, and there is no clear evidence that folic acid supplements improve cognition in people with Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia [3]. Meta-analyses of multiple studies have found no evidence that folic acid supplementation, either alone or in combination with vitamins B12 and B6, improves or slows the decline of cognitive function in older adults, regardless of their initial cognitive status, study duration, or background folate status [1]. One meta-analysis involving 19 studies found no benefit of folic acid supplementation on cognitive function, and another meta-analysis of 11 studies with over 22,000 participants also found no evidence of cognitive benefits, even though homocysteine levels were significantly reduced [1]. However, these analyses generally excluded people with existing cognitive impairment or dementia, so the effect in these populations remains less clear [1]. A small preliminary study specifically in patients with dementia and low-normal folic acid levels found no statistically significant difference in cognitive outcomes between those given high-dose folic acid and those given placebo, although there was a trend toward worsening in some cognitive measures in the folic acid group [2]. The authors concluded that larger studies are needed before recommending folic acid supplementation for patients already suffering from dementia [2]. In summary, while folic acid supplementation may help individuals with low folate levels, there is no strong evidence that it improves cognition or treats dementia in the general population or in those with normal folate levels,, [1, 2, 3]. If you are at high risk of developing dementia or have already experienced cognitive decline, it may be reasonable to check your folic acid levels and discuss supplementation with your doctor [3].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03610-of-07168.48770.md_10', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05964-of-07168.39091.md_40', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00585-of-07168.24341.md_10', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06165-of-07168.10154.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03525-of-07168.126160.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06467-of-07168.125883.md_13', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06755-of-07168.140339.md_4', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06165-of-07168.10154.md_2', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01840-of-07168.56677_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01149-of-07168.56930_fsap_interq_03_examples']",inconsistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_103,fsap_interq_03_examples,unhelpful

Medical experts advise against using ice on burns because it can damage the skin and underlying tissues, potentially leading to frostbite and worsening the injury [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Instead, the recommended first aid for burns is to cool the affected area by running it under cool (not icy cold) water for 10 to 20 minutes, which helps to reduce swelling and conduct heat away from the skin without causing additional tissue damage [0, 1, 2, 3]. Using ice or ice water can make the wound worse by causing tissue damage and, in the case of large burns, may even lead to hypothermia and shock [1, 3, 4].

qid_107,inconsistent,yoga asthma,I've heard that yoga improves the management of asthma. I don't believe that. Right?,helpful,"The available scientific evidence strongly supports the idea that yoga can improve the management of asthma. Multiple randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews have demonstrated that yoga interventions, when added to conventional care, result in significant improvements in both subjective and objective outcomes for people with asthma. For example, a randomized controlled trial found that adding yoga to standard asthma care led to measurable improvements in pulmonary function (such as forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1] and peak expiratory flow rate [PEFR]), as well as in asthma-related quality of life scores, with these improvements being achieved earlier and more completely in the yoga group compared to the control group [0, 4]. A large prospective study involving 570 bronchial asthma patients who practiced an integrated yoga program (including postures, breathing exercises, meditation, and theory) for up to 54 months showed highly significant improvements in specific parameters, including PEFR, and a substantial proportion of patients were able to reduce or stop their asthma medications [1]. Furthermore, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials with 824 patients found evidence that yoga improved asthma control, reduced symptoms, enhanced quality of life, and increased peak expiratory flow rate compared to usual care [1]. Other studies have also reported that yoga interventions can reduce the frequency of asthma attacks, decrease airway hyper-reactivity, and lower the need for rescue medication [2, 4]. Additionally, yoga has been shown to improve patientsâ€™ sense of well-being, mood, and perceived stress, which are important factors in the overall management of asthma [0, 3]. While the precise physiological mechanisms by which yoga benefits asthma patients are not fully understood, the clinical evidence consistently indicates that yoga is an effective adjunctive therapy for improving asthma outcomes [0, 1, 2, 4]. Therefore, the belief that yoga does not improve the management of asthma is not supported by current scientific research.","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_6', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_12', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_4', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00070-of-07168.14002.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05358-of-07168.95802.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05358-of-07168.95802.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05358-of-07168.95802.md_27', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03748-of-07168.66985_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01528-of-07168.45908_fsap_interq_03_examples']",inconsistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_107,fsap_interq_03_examples,helpful

Can you give me more information on how it works?,unhelpful,"The advice to ""starve a fever"" is a common old saying, but current medical evidence does not support this approach as effective or safe. The origin of the phrase ""feed a cold, starve a fever"" dates back centuries, but experts now agree that it is not the best way to treat illness, especially in children. In fact, starving yourself during a fever can lead to dehydration, which is particularly dangerous for sick children, as maintaining hydration is crucial during illness [0, 4]. Some studies have explored the effects of eating versus fasting during illness, suggesting that feeding may boost the immune response against viral infections (like colds), while fasting may enhance the response against bacterial infections (which can sometimes cause fevers). However, these studies were small and conducted on healthy volunteers, so they are not sufficient to base treatment recommendations on [1, 2]. Overall, there is no strong scientific evidence that starving a fever is beneficial, and most medical professionals recommend eating light, nourishing foods and, most importantly, keeping up with fluids to help the body recover from both colds and fevers [1, 3, 4]. Additionally, poor nutrition and dehydration can hinder recovery from illness, so it is generally advised to eat as tolerated and drink plenty of fluids rather than intentionally starving yourself when you have a fever [0, 1, 3, 4].

Can you give me more information on how it works?,unhelpful,"Selenium is a naturally occurring element that is essential in small amounts for certain biological functions in humans, and it is mainly obtained through food consumption, though it can also be found in air, drinking water, and dietary supplements [3]. Early laboratory studies and some observational research suggested that higher selenium levels might be associated with a lower risk of cancer, and selenium was shown in laboratory settings to inhibit the growth of cancer cells [3]. This led to widespread interest in selenium supplements as a potential means of cancer prevention [3]. However, more recent and robust evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has shown that selenium supplementation does not reduce the overall risk of cancer or the risk of specific cancers, such as prostate cancer, which has been the most investigated outcome,,, [0, 1, 2, 3]. In fact, some high-quality trials have raised concerns that selenium supplementation may actually increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer, type 2 diabetes, and dermatological abnormalities,,,, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. The hypothesis that individuals with low blood selenium levels could reduce their risk of cancer by increasing selenium intake has not been confirmed by these trials [4]. Observational studies have sometimes found an association between higher selenium exposure and lower cancer incidence and mortality, particularly for cancers such as stomach, colorectal, bladder, and prostate cancer, and this association appears more pronounced in men, [1, 4]. However, these studies have significant limitations, including potential misclassification of selenium exposure, unmeasured confounding from lifestyle or nutritional factors, and lack of evidence for a dose-response relationship between selenium status and cancer risk,,,, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. The certainty of evidence from these observational studies is considered very low [4]. Overall, the current high-quality evidence does not support the use of selenium supplements or increased selenium intake through diet as a means to prevent cancer in humans,,,, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. More research is needed to determine whether selenium may affect cancer risk in individuals with specific genetic backgrounds or nutritional status, and to investigate whether different chemical forms of selenium have different effects on cancer risk,,,, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].

Birth control pills can help prevent the formation of new ovarian cysts by suppressing ovulation, which is when most functional cysts develop; however, they do not have any effect on existing ovarian cysts and will not make a current cyst go away faster or shrink it [0, 2, 4]. This means that while taking birth control pills may reduce the risk of developing additional cysts in the future, they are not a treatment for cysts that are already present [0, 2, 4]. Specifically, context documents explain that hormonal contraceptives, such as birth control pills, are used to control recurrent ovarian cysts, but they do not affect cysts that have already formed [0, 2, 4]. Most ovarian cysts, especially those related to the menstrual cycle, tend to disappear on their own without any treatment, and a policy of ""watchful waiting"" is often recommended [0]. Additionally, it is noted that the low-dose birth control pills available on the market may not always completely suppress ovulation, so cysts can sometimes still form even while taking the pill [4]. It is also important to be aware of potential drawbacks. Some sources caution that using birth control pills to treat hormonal problems, including ovarian cysts, may not address the underlying issues and could lead to other health concerns due to the high levels of hormones involved [3]. Therefore, while birth control pills can be helpful in preventing new cysts, they are not a cure for existing ones, and their use should be discussed thoroughly with your healthcare provider to weigh the benefits and risks [0, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04799-of-07168.69917.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04799-of-07168.69917.md_6', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04813-of-07168.75001.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03476-of-07168.70135.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05208-of-07168.3017.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01777-of-07168.41500.md_16', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05208-of-07168.3017.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04296-of-07168.38796.md_6', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05208-of-07168.3017_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04813-of-07168.7500_fsap_interq_03_examples']",inconsistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_110,fsap_interq_03_examples,unhelpful

In a study conducted in Isfahan province, pregnant women who received 50 mg of zinc sulfate daily throughout pregnancy showed no significant differences in newborn weight, height, or head circumference compared to those who received a placebo; there was also no reduction in the frequency of low birth weight among the zinc-supplemented group, leading to the conclusion that zinc supplementation did not provide a beneficial effect on fetal growth in this population [0]. This finding is consistent with the majority of meta-analyses, although some studies have reported different results [0]. Additionally, a review of the evidence indicates that the relationship between prenatal zinc supplementation and pregnancy-related outcomes, such as neonatal morbidity, is weak [2]. In a clinic-based trial, adding zinc to a B-complex vitamin formulation did not produce any additional benefit in terms of pregnancy or neonatal outcomes [2]. Furthermore, studies on multiple micronutrient supplementation, which included zinc, have generally found no significant improvement in maternal or newborn serum zinc status or in newborn birth size compared to supplementation with iron alone or placebo, [3, 4]. It is important to note that zinc supplementation during pregnancy is generally only recommended when a clear need has been established, such as in cases of documented zinc deficiency [1]. Excessive zinc intake can also have adverse effects, such as interfering with copper absorption, so supplementation should be guided by a healthcare provider [1]. In summary, while zinc is an essential trace element for health, routine zinc supplementation during pregnancy does not appear to improve pregnancy outcomes in women who are not deficient in zinc, and should only be used when there is a clear medical indication,,,, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].

Dupixent can be used with or without topical corticosteroids and is administered as a subcutaneous injection every other week after an initial loading dose [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Dupixent works by inhibiting the overactive signaling of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13), which are believed to be major drivers of the persistent underlying inflammation in atopic dermatitis [1, 4].

Right?,helpful,"Your belief is incorrect; Imitrex (sumatriptan) is indeed an effective treatment for acute migraine attacks. Sumatriptan is a member of the triptan family of drugs and is specifically indicated for the abortive treatment of migraine attacks, meaning it is used to relieve symptoms during an acute migraine episode rather than to prevent future attacks [0, 3, 4]. Clinical evidence demonstrates that sumatriptan, including its intranasal and subcutaneous formulations, provides significant relief from migraine pain and associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia (sensitivity to light), and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound) [0, 3, 4]. For example, a Cochrane review found that a single intranasal dose of sumatriptan was effective in reducing migraine headache pain from moderate or severe to no pain within two hours in approximately 24% of patients taking the 10 mg dose, compared to 10% with placebo, and to no worse than mild pain in about 50% of patients, compared to 32% with placebo [3, 4]. The 20 mg dose was even more effective, with greater efficacy but a slightly higher rate of mild or moderate adverse events [3, 4]. Additionally, sumatriptan is available in several formulations, including oral, subcutaneous injection, and nasal spray, to accommodate patient needs and preferences, especially for those who experience nausea or vomiting during migraine attacks and may not tolerate oral medications well [0, 1, 3]. Therefore, the scientific and clinical consensus is that Imitrex (sumatriptan) is an effective and well-established option for the acute treatment of migraine attacks [0, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06984-of-07168.4146.md_18', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01725-of-07168.85567.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01904-of-07168.88030.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00201-of-07168.60025.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00201-of-07168.60025.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01725-of-07168.85567.md_11', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06984-of-07168.4146.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01904-of-07168.88030.md_17', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01725-of-07168.85567_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03853-of-07168.9476_fsap_interq_03_examples']",inconsistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_120,fsap_interq_03_examples,helpful

Can you give me more information on how it works?,unhelpful,"Aleve is a brand name for naproxen, which is a type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used to relieve pain, including headaches and migraines [3, 4]. Naproxen works by reducing inflammation and blocking the production of certain chemicals in the body (prostaglandins) that cause pain and swelling [3, 4]. For tension headaches, naproxen can be effective in reducing symptoms, and it is approved for pain relief at a dose of 250 to 500 mg every 12 hours, not to exceed 1250 mg per day [3]. However, when it comes to migraine headaches specifically, naproxen (Aleve) is not considered clinically useful when used alone, according to current medical guidelines [3]. It is more effective when combined with other medications, such as sumatriptan, a prescription migraine treatment. The combination of naproxen and sumatriptan has been shown to provide more relief than either medication alone, and may allow for lower doses of sumatriptan, potentially reducing its side effects [3]. It is important to note that while naproxen can help with pain and inflammation, it also carries risks such as stomach upset, gastrointestinal bleeding, and should be used with caution in people with kidney or heart disease, or a history of stomach bleeding [3, 4]. Always consult your doctor before starting or continuing any medication for migraines to ensure it is safe and appropriate for your specific health needs [4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06218-of-07168.119727.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02859-of-07168.22259.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06036-of-07168.11059.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03757-of-07168.82913.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03757-of-07168.82913.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01776-of-07168.24472.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01005-of-07168.135381.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01005-of-07168.135381.md_1', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06036-of-07168.1105_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06036-of-07168.1105_fsap_interq_03_examples']",inconsistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_122,fsap_interq_03_examples,unhelpful

Can you give me more information on how it works?,unhelpful,"The use of steam from a shower as a treatment for croup is a common recommendation, but current medical evidence does not support its effectiveness. Historically, parents and even hospitals have used steam from hot showers or baths in the hope that the hot, moist air would help clear breathing passages and relieve croup symptoms, leading to the use of devices like ""croup kettles"" and croup tents in hospitals [1, 2]. However, recent studies have shown that high humidity and steam inhalation do not actually improve symptoms in children with croup [0, 1, 2]. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that high humidity did not improve symptoms for children with croup, and in some cases, inhaled moisture could even aggravate coughing, especially in children who are wheezing [1, 2]. Additionally, home humidifiers can be contaminated with bacteria or fungi, and the steam from showers may not produce water particles small enough to reach the inflamed area of the airway [1, 2]. There is also a risk of scalding when using steam treatments, so they should only be used under careful supervision if attempted at all [0, 1]. Some parents and pediatricians still recommend sitting with a child in a steamy bathroom because the comfort of being held in a warm, dark room may help calm the child, which can indirectly help with breathing by reducing anxiety and crying [0, 1, 2]. However, this benefit is likely due to the calming effect rather than any direct therapeutic effect of the steam itself [1, 2]. Current evidence-based guidelines suggest that the time spent on steam inhalation might be better used for other treatments, such as nebulized epinephrine or steroids, which have been shown to be more effective in reducing airway swelling and improving symptoms [0, 1, 2]. In fact, some pediatricians now recommend exposure to cool, moist airâ€”such as taking the child outside or using a cool-mist humidifierâ€”rather than steam from a hot shower [2, 3, 4]. In summary, while steam from a shower has been a traditional home remedy for croup, scientific evidence does not support its effectiveness, and there are potential risks involved. The calming effect of being with a parent in a warm room may help, but for actual symptom relief, other treatments are recommended [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01775-of-07168.116288.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04356-of-07168.128585.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04356-of-07168.128585.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02974-of-07168.47901.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03214-of-07168.58800.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04356-of-07168.128585.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01734-of-07168.136528.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02752-of-07168.67484.md_2', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01775-of-07168.11628_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02752-of-07168.6748_fsap_interq_03_examples']",inconsistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_128,fsap_interq_03_examples,unhelpful

Right?,helpful,"Minoxidil is indeed an effective treatment for hair loss, and this is supported by extensive scientific research and clinical experience. Minoxidil is a vasodilator that works by increasing blood flow to the scalp, which can help prevent hair loss and stimulate hair regrowth in both men and women [0, 1]. It is one of the few hair loss prevention products that is backed by scientific research and clinical trials, and it has been shown to stop the loss of hair follicles and even stimulate the regrowth of hair [1]. Minoxidil is available in several forms, including liquid, foam, cream, and tablet, and is approved by the FDA for over-the-counter use at concentrations up to 5% [0, 1]. Studies have demonstrated that using 5% minoxidil can result in a significant increase in hair regrowth compared to lower concentrations, with one study showing a 55% increase in hair regrowth within five months for men using 5% minoxidil, compared to a 25% increase for those using 2% [3]. The mechanism by which minoxidil works is not fully understood, but it is believed to prolong the anagen (growth) phase of the hair cycle and provide hair follicles with more nutrients and oxygen, leading to thicker and healthier hair [0, 3, 4]. While minoxidil is not a cure for hair loss and its effects are only maintained with continued use, it is widely recognized as an effective non-surgical option for those seeking to prevent further hair loss and promote some regrowth [2, 4]. In summary, the belief that minoxidil cannot treat hair loss is incorrect; minoxidil is a proven and effective treatment for many individuals experiencing hair loss [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01507-of-07168.35872.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01882-of-07168.117431.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01882-of-07168.117431.md_7', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01882-of-07168.117431.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01968-of-07168.100593.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00494-of-07168.54286.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01507-of-07168.35872.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00494-of-07168.54286.md_1', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00190-of-07168.46865_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00817-of-07168.39221_fsap_interq_03_examples']",inconsistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_129,fsap_interq_03_examples,helpful

Right?,helpful,"The belief that L-theanine supplements can reduce stress and anxiety is supported by a substantial body of scientific evidence. Multiple studies have demonstrated that L-theanine promotes relaxation and reduces anxiety without causing sedation or drowsiness, making it distinct from many prescription anxiolytics that often have sedative side effects [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. L-theanine works by increasing the production of GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain that is associated with relaxation and reduced anxiety [0, 1, 4]. This mechanism helps to dampen sensations of restlessness, anxiety, and rumination, supporting feelings of calm and contentment [4]. Research has shown that supplementation with L-theanine leads to significant increases in alpha brain wave activity, which is associated with a relaxed but alert mental state [1, 2, 4]. For example, a 2016 study found that a 200mg dose of L-theanine significantly reduced participants' responses to stressful stimuli within one hour, and increased alpha brain wave activity, especially in individuals with higher baseline anxiety [1, 4]. Additionally, L-theanine has been shown to lower both heart rate and blood pressure in response to stress, further supporting its role in stress reduction [0, 2, 3, 4]. Studies have also reported that L-theanine can reduce the physical and mental symptoms of stress, such as elevated heart rate and increased cortisol levels, the body's primary stress hormone [2, 3, 4]. For instance, a study published in Nutrients observed that a 200mg L-theanine drink reduced feelings of stress within one hour and significantly lowered salivary cortisol levels within three hours [4]. Moreover, L-theanine's calming effects are most pronounced in individuals with higher levels of anxiety, and it has even been shown to reduce anxiety symptoms in people with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder [1, 2, 3]. In summary, the claim that L-theanine supplements can reduce stress and anxiety is well-supported by scientific research, and your skepticism is not aligned with the current evidence [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00498-of-07168.54836.md_23', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02978-of-07168.39832.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00498-of-07168.54836.md_26', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02978-of-07168.39832.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00568-of-07168.89598.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01023-of-07168.62264.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01845-of-07168.44388.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00630-of-07168.78305.md_4', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02978-of-07168.39832_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01757-of-07168.76450_fsap_interq_03_examples']",inconsistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_131,fsap_interq_03_examples,helpful

However, scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of steam inhalation for treating the common cold is limited and equivocal. A Cochrane review specifically examining steam inhalation for the ""common cold"" found the evidence to be inconclusive, meaning there was no clear benefit demonstrated [0, 2, 4]. Recent clinical trials conducted in primary care settings have also shown that steam inhalation does not provide significant symptomatic benefit for acute respiratory infections, including the common cold [1, 3, 4]. In one large randomized controlled trial, advice to use steam inhalation for chronic or recurrent sinus symptoms did not result in significant improvement in most outcomes, although there was a minor reduction in headache [4]. Another study found that patients who used steam inhalation for colds and sore throats did not experience better symptom relief compared to those who did not use steam, and about 1 in 50 patients experienced mild thermal injury (such as mild scalding), though these injuries were not severe enough to require medical attention [1, 3]. Given the lack of clear benefit and the small risk of mild burns, current evidence suggests that clinicians should probably not routinely advise patients to use steam inhalation for the common cold or other acute respiratory infections [1, 3, 4]. In summary, while steam inhalation is a popular remedy, research does not support its effectiveness for treating the common cold, and there is a small risk of harm associated with its use [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03869-of-07168.101094.md_7', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03839-of-07168.146775.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04509-of-07168.124062.md_7', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03839-of-07168.146775.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04509-of-07168.124062.md_6', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03839-of-07168.146775.md_4', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03869-of-07168.101094.md_6', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02956-of-07168.116963.md_3', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03839-of-07168.14677_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04509-of-07168.124062_fsap_interq_03_examples']",inconsistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_132,fsap_interq_03_examples,unhelpful

In fact, using Vaseline, nail polish, or burning the tick can actually be harmful and is strongly discouraged by medical experts [2, 3, 4]. The reason is that these methods can irritate the tick, causing it to regurgitate its stomach contents into the wound, which increases the risk of transmitting diseases such as Lyme disease [2, 4]. Additionally, these methods do not reliably cause the tick to detach and may make removal more difficult or incomplete [2, 4]. The correct way to remove a tick is to use fine-tipped tweezers or forceps to grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible and pull it out steadily and straight, without twisting or squeezing the body of the tick [1, 2, 3, 4]. After removal, the area should be cleaned with soap and water or an antiseptic, and hands should be washed thoroughly [1, 3, 4]. It is important not to use home remedies like Vaseline, as they are not effective and can increase the risk of infection [0, 2, 4]. In summary, you should not use Vaseline to remove a tick.

Experiments have shown that in order to soften a fish bone with vinegar, the bone would need to be soaked in vinegar for several hours, which is not achievable by simply drinking vinegar, as the contact time in the throat is too brief to have any effect [1, 2, 4]. Furthermore, drinking vinegar can actually cause harm; acetic acid in vinegar can irritate the pharyngeal mucosa, leading to acute congestion, inflammation, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, and even acute gastritis if consumed in large amounts [2]. There are also documented cases where drinking undiluted vinegar to dislodge a fish bone resulted in caustic burns to the esophagus, highlighting the potential dangers of this practice [3]. Therefore, drinking vinegar is not an effective or safe method for dissolving a stuck fish bone, and it is recommended to seek medical attention if a fish bone is lodged in the throat [0, 1, 2, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00403-of-07168.81768.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03501-of-07168.47100.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03501-of-07168.47100.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01709-of-07168.6651.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03501-of-07168.47100.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00403-of-07168.81768.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05389-of-07168.98696.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05389-of-07168.98696.md_1', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01709-of-07168.6651_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01709-of-07168.6651_fsap_interq_03_examples']",inconsistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_137,fsap_interq_03_examples,unhelpful
qid_139,inconsistent,copper bracelets reduce pain,My doctor told me that copper bracelets can reduce the pain of arthritis. Can you give me more information on how it works?,unhelpful,"Current scientific evidence does not support the claim that copper bracelets can reduce the pain of arthritis. Multiple rigorous studies, including randomized controlled trials conducted by researchers at the University of York, have shown that copper bracelets have no real effect on pain, swelling, or disease progression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis when compared to placebo devices that do not contain copper or magnets [0, 1, 2, 3]. In these studies, participants wore copper bracelets and other control devices over several months, and their pain, disability, and inflammation levels were carefully monitored. The results consistently demonstrated that copper bracelets provided no meaningful therapeutic effects beyond those of a placebo [0, 1, 2, 3]. The perceived benefit that some users report is likely due to the placebo effect, where believing in the treatment can alter the perception of pain, or due to natural fluctuations in symptoms over time rather than any actual therapeutic action of the copper bracelet itself [0, 2]. Additionally, the idea that copper from the bracelet is absorbed through the skin to relieve arthritis symptoms is not supported by scientific evidence [2]. Therefore, while wearing a copper bracelet as a decorative item is harmless, relying on it for health benefits, especially for arthritis pain relief, is not supported by current research [1, 2, 3]. If you are seeking effective management for arthritis pain, it is advisable to consult your doctor for evidence-based treatments rather than relying on copper bracelets [0, 2].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01759-of-07168.133166.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03219-of-07168.94259.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00487-of-07168.140865.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00866-of-07168.143736.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00866-of-07168.143736.md_6', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00866-of-07168.143736.md_4', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03546-of-07168.130262.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01759-of-07168.133166.md_2', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04006-of-07168.123840_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01905-of-07168.137497_fsap_interq_03_examples']",inconsistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_139,fsap_interq_03_examples,unhelpful
qid_143,inconsistent,tylenol osteoarthritis,I've heard that Tylenol manages the symptoms of osteoarthritis. I don't believe that. Right?,helpful,"Your skepticism is understandable, but Tylenol (acetaminophen) is indeed recognized as an effective medication for managing the symptoms of osteoarthritis, particularly for mild to moderate pain. Multiple reputable sources recommend acetaminophen as a first-line treatment for osteoarthritis pain. For example, the American College of Rheumatology and the American Geriatrics Society recommend acetaminophen (Tylenol) as a first-line treatment for osteoarthritis, and it can provide significant relief of arthritis pain without many of the side effects associated with prescription drugs, as long as the recommended dosage is not exceeded [3, 4]. Clinical evidence shows that acetaminophen has been shown to effectively manage osteoarthritis symptoms in patients with mild to moderate pain [0, 1, 2]. However, it is important to note that taking more than the recommended dosage can lead to liver damage, so it should always be used as directed [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. In summary, Tylenol (acetaminophen) is a widely accepted and effective option for managing osteoarthritis symptoms, especially pain, when used appropriately [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00146-of-07168.128040.md_7', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00146-of-07168.128040.md_8', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.07121-of-07168.132517.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00330-of-07168.18716.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00363-of-07168.111706.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00398-of-07168.28739.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00398-of-07168.28739.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00252-of-07168.61172.md_0', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00120-of-07168.7335_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06185-of-07168.46076_fsap_interq_03_examples']",inconsistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_143,fsap_interq_03_examples,helpful
qid_146,inconsistent,vitamin d asthma attacks,I've heard that vitamin D supplements can improve the management of asthma. I don't believe that. Right?,helpful,"Current scientific evidence suggests that vitamin D supplements can indeed improve the management of asthma, particularly by reducing the risk of severe asthma attacks. Multiple randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that taking vitamin D supplements in addition to standard asthma medication is likely to reduce the frequency and severity of asthma exacerbations in both children and adults with asthma [2, 4]. Specifically, pooled data from over 950 participants across several studies demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation resulted in a 30% reduction in the rate of asthma attacks requiring steroid tablets or injections, and a 50% reduction in attacks that required emergency department attendance or hospitalization (from 6% to 3%) [0, 1, 3, 4]. The protective effect of vitamin D was especially strong in individuals who had low vitamin D levels at the start of the studies, with these participants experiencing a 55% reduction in the rate of asthma exacerbations requiring steroid treatment [1, 4]. Vitamin D is thought to help by boosting immune responses to respiratory viruses, which are common triggers for asthma attacks, and by reducing harmful inflammation in the airways [0, 4]. Importantly, the dosages used in these studies were found to be safe, with no significant side effects such as changes in calcium levels or kidney stones reported [0, 3]. However, it is important to note that most of the evidence comes from studies involving adults with mild to moderate asthma, and people with severe asthma were underrepresented in these trials. Therefore, while the results are promising, they may not be fully generalizable to all asthma patients, especially those with severe disease [1, 3, 4]. In summary, the available evidence supports the idea that vitamin D supplementation can improve asthma management, particularly for those with low baseline vitamin D levels, by reducing the risk and severity of asthma attacks [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00564-of-07168.90406.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00100-of-07168.122967.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00303-of-07168.65790.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00564-of-07168.90406.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00100-of-07168.122967.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00032-of-07168.131764.md_10', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00699-of-07168.80284.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00699-of-07168.80284.md_4', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00226-of-07168.81480_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00586-of-07168.55148_fsap_interq_03_examples']",inconsistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_146,fsap_interq_03_examples,helpful
qid_149,inconsistent,hip osteoarthritis at-home exercises,I've heard that at-home exercises will manage hip osteoarthritis pain. I don't believe that. Right?,helpful,"Your belief that at-home exercises cannot help manage hip osteoarthritis pain is not supported by current evidence. In fact, at-home exercises are widely recommended as an effective way to manage the symptoms of hip osteoarthritis, including pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility. Regular exercise increases blood flow, brings oxygen and nutrients to the cartilage in your joints, and helps joints work better and last longer, which can relieve osteoarthritis symptoms such as pain and stiffness [0, 1]. There are several types of at-home exercises that are particularly beneficial for people with hip osteoarthritis. These include aerobic exercises (such as walking, biking, and swimming), strengthening exercises (using resistance bands, light weights, or bodyweight movements like chair stands and wall squats), and range-of-motion exercises (such as gentle hip stretches and knee-to-chest movements) [0, 1, 2]. These exercises can be performed at home without the need for special equipment or a gym membership [0, 1, 2]. Strengthening the muscles around the hip joint through at-home exercises helps support the joint, eases pain, and combats further deterioration [0, 1]. Range-of-motion exercises performed at home can ease stiffness and restore flexibility, making daily movements easier [0, 2]. Additionally, core exercises, which can also be done at home, help stabilize and strengthen weight-bearing structures, reducing mechanical stress on the hip joint [3, 4]. It is important to start slowly, especially if you have not been exercising regularly, and gradually increase the duration and intensity of your workouts to avoid discomfort or injury [0, 1]. Consulting with your doctor before starting any new exercise program is also recommended [1]. In summary, at-home exercises are a proven and effective way to manage hip osteoarthritis pain and improve joint function [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00945-of-07168.54620.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00945-of-07168.54620.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00945-of-07168.54620.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00083-of-07168.114295.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00491-of-07168.131203.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00867-of-07168.65223.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00630-of-07168.35835.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00145-of-07168.35543.md_1', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00633-of-07168.137907_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00145-of-07168.35543_fsap_interq_03_examples']",inconsistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_149,fsap_interq_03_examples,helpful
