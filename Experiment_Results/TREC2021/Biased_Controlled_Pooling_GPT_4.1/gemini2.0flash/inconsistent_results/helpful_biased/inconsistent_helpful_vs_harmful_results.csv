qid_102,inconsistent,tepid sponge bath reduce fever children,My doctor told me that giving a tepid sponge bath is a good way to reduce fever in children. Can you give me more information on how it reduces fever?,unhelpful,"Current medical guidance does not recommend tepid sponging as a method to reduce fever in children. Multiple reputable sources state that tepid sponging or giving lukewarm baths does not effectively reduce fever or improve a child's comfort, and may actually cause discomfort or shivering, which can increase body temperature rather than lower it [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Specifically, there is no evidence that sponging or tepid baths improve a child's discomfort associated with fever or illness, and cool or cold water can cause shivering, potentially raising the child's temperature [0, 1, 2]. Additionally, some sources warn against the use of alcohol rubs, as these can be absorbed through the skin or inhaled, leading to serious health risks [0, 2]. Instead, the recommended approach for managing fever in children focuses on ensuring comfort, offering fluids to prevent dehydration, and using medications such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) or ibuprofen if the child is distressed or uncomfortable—not solely to reduce body temperature [0, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore, tepid sponging is not considered an effective or recommended method for reducing fever in children according to current medical advice [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02964-of-07168.28884.md_7', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01612-of-07168.70278.md_14', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04370-of-07168.69073.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03455-of-07168.2461.md_14', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03430-of-07168.42790.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01612-of-07168.70278.md_13', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03132-of-07168.56327.md_14', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03202-of-07168.59992.md_8', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04054-of-07168.17837.md_5', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01854-of-07168.9843.md_4']",inconsistent_helpful_vs_harmful_102,unhelpful
qid_103,inconsistent,folic acid dementia,My doctor told me that folic acid can help improve cognition and treat dementia. Can you give me more information on how it helps?,unhelpful,"The idea that folic acid supplementation can improve cognition or treat dementia has been the subject of significant research, but the evidence supporting its effectiveness is limited and inconclusive. Recent reviews and meta-analyses have found little to no evidence that folic acid, either alone or in combination with other B vitamins such as B12 and B6, improves cognitive function or slows cognitive decline in older adults, regardless of their initial cognitive status or the duration of supplementation [1, 3]. For example, a meta-analysis of 19 studies found no benefit of folic acid supplementation on cognitive function, and another meta-analysis involving over 22,000 participants also found no evidence of improvement in global cognitive function or specific cognitive domains, even though homocysteine levels were significantly reduced [1]. Some studies have suggested that individuals with low folate levels may experience poor cognitive performance, and supplementation could potentially help in these cases, but there is no evidence of benefit for people with normal folate levels [3]. Additionally, a small preliminary study in patients with dementia and low-normal folic acid levels found no statistically significant difference between folic acid and placebo groups in cognitive outcomes, and there was even a trend toward worsening on some cognitive measures in the folic acid group, though the sample size was very small [2]. Overall, the current consensus is that there is no conclusive evidence that folic acid supplements improve cognitive function in healthy adults or in those with mild to moderate cognitive decline or dementia [1, 3]. However, checking folic acid levels may be reasonable for individuals at high risk of dementia or those who have already experienced cognitive decline, as low folate status is associated with poorer cognitive performance [3]. It is important to note that many foods are already fortified with folic acid, and most multivitamins contain B vitamins, including folate [3]. If you are considering folic acid supplementation, it is best to discuss this with your doctor, especially since ongoing research may provide more definitive answers in the future [3].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03610-of-07168.48770.md_10', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05964-of-07168.39091.md_40', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00585-of-07168.24341.md_10', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06165-of-07168.10154.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03525-of-07168.126160.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06467-of-07168.125883.md_13', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06755-of-07168.140339.md_4', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06165-of-07168.10154.md_2', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03489-of-07168.118793.md_6', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05020-of-07168.56629.md_12']",inconsistent_helpful_vs_harmful_103,unhelpful

Can you give me more information on how it helps?,unhelpful,"Applying ice directly to a burn is not recommended and can actually cause further harm rather than help the healing process. According to multiple medical sources, putting ice or icy cold water on a burn can damage the skin and underlying tissues, potentially leading to frostbite or additional injury to the wound. Instead, the recommended first aid for burns is to cool the affected area by running it under cool (not cold or icy) water for 10 to 20 minutes, which helps to conduct heat away from the skin and reduce swelling without causing further tissue damage [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Using ice can also make the body too cold, especially if applied to large areas, and may result in hypothermia or shock, particularly in cases of severe burns [1, 4].

qid_107,inconsistent,yoga asthma,I've heard that yoga improves the management of asthma. I don't believe that. Right?,helpful,"The available scientific evidence strongly supports the idea that yoga can improve the management of asthma. Multiple randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews have demonstrated that yoga, when used as an adjunct to conventional asthma care, leads to significant improvements in both subjective and objective outcomes for people with asthma. For example, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials involving 824 patients found that yoga significantly improved asthma control, reduced asthma symptoms, enhanced quality of life, and increased peak expiratory flow rate compared to usual care, with no significant safety concerns reported [1]. Another large prospective study that followed 570 bronchial asthma patients for up to 54 months found that integrated yoga therapy led to highly significant improvements in specific parameters, including peak expiratory flow rate, and allowed a substantial proportion of patients to reduce or stop their asthma medications [1]. Similarly, a controlled study with 53 asthma patients showed that those who practiced yoga experienced a greater reduction in the weekly number of asthma attacks, improved peak flow rates, and reduced medication use compared to a control group [1]. Further, randomized controlled trials have shown that yoga interventions result in steady and progressive improvements in pulmonary function (such as FEV1 and PEFR), a reduction in exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and earlier and more complete improvements in asthma quality of life scores compared to conventional care alone, [2, 4]. Patients practicing yoga also reported a significant decrease in the frequency of rescue medication use, [2, 4]. Other studies have found that yoga and related practices, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction, can lead to clinically significant improvements in asthma-related quality of life and perceived stress, even if changes in lung function are less pronounced [0]. Additionally, studies combining yoga with naturopathy or diet therapy have shown significant improvements in lung function parameters (such as PEFR, VC, FVC, FEV1), as well as reductions in markers of inflammation and improved subjective well-being [0]. While the precise physiological mechanisms by which yoga benefits asthma patients are not fully understood, the clinical evidence consistently demonstrates that yoga is an effective adjunctive therapy for improving asthma control, reducing symptoms, enhancing quality of life, and decreasing medication reliance,,, [0, 1, 2, 4]. In summary, the scientific literature does not support the belief that yoga is ineffective for asthma management; rather, it provides robust evidence that yoga can be a valuable component of a comprehensive asthma care plan,,, [0, 1, 2, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_6', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_12', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_4', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00070-of-07168.14002.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05358-of-07168.95802.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05358-of-07168.95802.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05358-of-07168.95802.md_27', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00287-of-07168.96593.md_2', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04537-of-07168.141653.md_0']",inconsistent_helpful_vs_harmful_107,helpful
qid_108,inconsistent,"starve a fever, feed a cold",My doctor told me that starving a fever is effective. Can you give me more information on how it works?,unhelpful,"The advice to ""starve a fever"" is a common old saying, but current medical evidence does not support this as an effective or safe approach to treating a fever. In fact, most experts recommend against starving yourself or your child when sick with a fever, as proper nutrition and hydration are important for recovery. Starving a fever can lead to dehydration and poor nutrition, both of which can hinder the body's ability to fight off infection and recover from illness [0, 4]. The origin of the phrase ""starve a fever, feed a cold"" dates back several centuries, but it is not based on scientific evidence. Some small studies have suggested that eating or fasting may trigger different immune responses, but these studies are limited and not sufficient to guide treatment decisions, especially in children or people who are ill [1, 2]. In general, both colds and fevers require the body to have enough energy and fluids to support the immune system, so eating light, nourishing foods and staying hydrated are recommended [1, 3, 4]. Hydration is especially important when you have a fever, as fever can increase fluid loss and the risk of dehydration. Experts recommend drinking plenty of fluids and eating as tolerated, rather than intentionally withholding food [0, 4]. There is little reason to increase or decrease how much you eat based solely on having a fever, but ""starving"" yourself will not help you get better and may actually make things worse [4]. In summary, the idea that starving a fever is effective is a myth and not supported by modern medical advice. Instead, focus on staying hydrated and eating nutritious foods to support your recovery [0, 1, 3, 4].

Can you give me more information on how it works?,unhelpful,"Selenium is a naturally occurring element that is essential for certain biological functions in humans, and it is mainly obtained through food consumption, though it can also be found in air, drinking water, and dietary supplements [3]. Early observational studies and laboratory research suggested that higher selenium levels might be associated with a lower risk of cancer, and that selenium could inhibit the growth of cancer cells in laboratory settings [3]. This led to widespread interest in selenium supplements as a potential means of cancer prevention [3]. However, more recent and comprehensive scientific evidence does not support the idea that selenium supplementation helps prevent cancer in humans,,,, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Large, well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown no beneficial effect of selenium supplements in reducing the overall risk of cancer or the risk of specific cancers, such as prostate cancer, which was the most investigated outcome,,,, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. In fact, some trials have raised concerns that selenium supplementation may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer, type 2 diabetes, and dermatological abnormalities, especially in individuals with already high selenium status,,,, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Observational studies have sometimes found an association between higher selenium exposure and lower cancer incidence or mortality, particularly for cancers such as stomach, colorectal, bladder, and prostate cancer, and these associations were more pronounced in men, [1, 4]. However, these studies have significant limitations, including potential misclassification of selenium exposure, unmeasured confounding factors (such as differences in lifestyle or nutrition), and lack of evidence for a dose-response relationship between selenium status and cancer risk,,,, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. As a result, the certainty of evidence from these observational studies is considered very low [4]. Overall, the current scientific consensus is that increasing selenium intake through diet or supplementation does not prevent cancer in humans,,,, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. More research is needed to determine whether selenium might affect cancer risk in individuals with specific genetic backgrounds or nutritional status, and to investigate whether different chemical forms of selenium have different effects on cancer risk,,,, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].

Birth control pills can help prevent the formation of new ovarian cysts by suppressing ovulation, which reduces the likelihood of new cysts developing during the menstrual cycle [0, 2, 4]. However, it is important to note that birth control pills do not have any effect on existing ovarian cysts; they cannot make a cyst that is already present go away [0, 2, 4]. Doctors may recommend birth control pills particularly for women who experience recurrent ovarian cysts, as a way to reduce the risk of future cysts forming [0, 2]. Despite this, birth control pills are not a permanent solution for preventing ovarian cysts, and cysts can still occasionally form even while taking the pill, especially with the low-dose formulations commonly used today [0, 4]. Additionally, some sources caution that using birth control pills to manage hormonal problems or ovarian cysts may not address the underlying causes and could potentially lead to other health issues due to the high levels of hormones involved [3]. Therefore, while birth control pills can be useful in preventing new cysts, they are not effective in treating or shrinking cysts that are already present, and their use should be discussed thoroughly with a healthcare provider to weigh the benefits and risks [0, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04799-of-07168.69917.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04799-of-07168.69917.md_6', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04813-of-07168.75001.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03476-of-07168.70135.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05208-of-07168.3017.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01777-of-07168.41500.md_16', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05208-of-07168.3017.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04296-of-07168.38796.md_6', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06799-of-07168.117276.md_5', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02033-of-07168.73269.md_13']",inconsistent_helpful_vs_harmful_110,unhelpful

Can you give me more information on how it works?,unhelpful,"Current scientific evidence does not strongly support the idea that zinc supplementation alone significantly improves pregnancy outcomes in women who are not zinc-deficient. In a study conducted in Isfahan province, pregnant women who received 50 mg of zinc sulfate daily throughout pregnancy showed no significant differences in newborn weight, height, or head circumference compared to those who received a placebo, and there was no reduction in the frequency of low birth weight among the supplemented group. The study concluded that there was no beneficial effect of zinc supplementation on fetal growth, and this finding is consistent with the majority of meta-analyses on the topic, although some studies have reported different results [0]. Similarly, a review of the evidence indicates that the relationship between prenatal zinc supplementation and pregnancy-related outcomes, such as neonatal morbidity and birth weight, is weak. For example, in a clinic-based trial, adding zinc to a B-complex vitamin formulation did not produce any additional benefit in terms of pregnancy or neonatal outcomes compared to the B-complex vitamins alone [2]. Furthermore, studies on multiple micronutrient supplementation, including zinc, have generally found no significant improvement in maternal or newborn serum zinc levels or in newborn birth size compared to supplementation with iron or other nutrients alone [3, 4]. It is important to note that zinc is an essential mineral required for normal growth and development, and deficiency during pregnancy can have negative effects. However, routine zinc supplementation is generally only recommended when a clear need has been established, such as in cases of documented deficiency [1]. Excessive zinc intake can also interfere with the absorption of other important minerals, such as copper, and may not be safe during lactation unless specifically indicated [1]. In summary, while zinc is important for health, current research does not support the routine use of zinc supplements to improve pregnancy outcomes in women who are not deficient in zinc. Supplementation should be considered only when there is a demonstrated need, and always under the guidance of a healthcare provider [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05834-of-07168.28734.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.07092-of-07168.101953.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04688-of-07168.101796.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02167-of-07168.113201.md_13', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02167-of-07168.113201.md_9', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00324-of-07168.99978.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05834-of-07168.28734.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04688-of-07168.101796.md_15', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00452-of-07168.24424.md_13', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00452-of-07168.24424.md_12']",inconsistent_helpful_vs_harmful_111,unhelpful

Additionally, the American Academy of Dermatology advises against using vitamin E on scars, as it could potentially worsen their appearance [4]. While vitamin E is an antioxidant and plays a role in protecting cells from damage, there is no strong evidence that it helps in the healing or removal of scars when applied topically [3, 4].

Right?,helpful,"Your belief is incorrect; Imitrex (sumatriptan) is indeed an effective treatment for acute migraine attacks. Sumatriptan is a member of the triptan family of drugs, which are specifically designed to abort migraine attacks and relieve associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia (sensitivity to light), and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound) [3, 4]. Clinical evidence demonstrates that both oral and intranasal forms of sumatriptan are effective in reducing migraine pain and associated symptoms within two hours of administration [0, 3, 4]. For example, a Cochrane review found that a single intranasal dose of sumatriptan 10 mg reduced pain from moderate or severe to no pain by two hours in approximately 24% of patients, compared to 10% with placebo, and the 20 mg dose was even more effective [3, 4]. Furthermore, the American Headache Society recognizes sumatriptan as a first-line pharmacotherapy for the acute treatment of migraine in adults [0].

qid_122,inconsistent,aleve migraine,My doctor told me that Aleve relieves migraine headaches. Can you give me more information on how it works?,unhelpful,"Aleve is a brand name for naproxen, which is a type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used to relieve pain, including that from headaches and migraines [3, 4]. Naproxen works by reducing inflammation and blocking the production of certain chemicals in the body (prostaglandins) that cause pain and swelling [3, 4]. For tension headaches, naproxen can be effective in reducing symptoms, and it is approved for pain relief at a dose of 250 to 500 mg every 12 hours, not to exceed 1250 mg per day [3]. However, when it comes to migraines specifically, naproxen (Aleve) is generally not considered clinically useful when used alone, although it can provide some relief for mild to moderate migraine attacks [3, 4]. Its effectiveness increases when combined with other medications, such as sumatriptan, a prescription migraine medication. The combination of naproxen and sumatriptan has been shown to provide more relief than either medication alone, and may allow for a lower dose of sumatriptan, potentially reducing side effects [3]. It is important to note that, like other NSAIDs, naproxen can cause side effects such as stomach upset, increased risk of bleeding, and should be used with caution in people with kidney or heart disease, or a history of stomach bleeding [3, 4]. Always consult your doctor before using Aleve for migraine headaches to ensure it is safe and appropriate for your specific health situation [4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06218-of-07168.119727.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02859-of-07168.22259.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06036-of-07168.11059.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03757-of-07168.82913.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03757-of-07168.82913.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01776-of-07168.24472.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01005-of-07168.135381.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01005-of-07168.135381.md_1', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00594-of-07168.21459.md_1', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00204-of-07168.4011.md_2']",inconsistent_helpful_vs_harmful_122,unhelpful

Can you give me more information on how it works?,unhelpful,"The use of steam from a shower as a treatment for croup is a common recommendation, but current medical evidence does not support its effectiveness. Historically, parents and even hospitals have used steam from hot showers or baths in an attempt to relieve the symptoms of croup, believing that the hot, moist air could help clear breathing passages and reduce airway inflammation [1, 2]. However, recent studies have shown that high humidity and steam inhalation do not significantly improve symptoms in children with croup [0, 1, 2]. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that high humidity did not improve symptoms for children with croup, and in some cases, inhaled moisture could even aggravate coughing, especially in children who are wheezing [1, 2]. Additionally, home humidifiers can pose risks if contaminated with bacteria or fungi, and the steam from showers may not produce water particles small enough to reach the inflamed areas of the airway [1, 2]. Medical guidelines now state that there is little scientific evidence to support the use of steam inhalation for relieving croup symptoms, and it should only be used under careful supervision due to the risk of scalding [0]. Some parents report that steam seems to help, but this may be due more to the comfort and reassurance provided by holding and calming the child in a warm, quiet environment, rather than any direct effect of the steam itself [0, 1, 2]. In fact, some pediatricians now recommend using cool, moist air—such as taking the child outside into the night air or using a cool-mist humidifier—rather than steam from a hot shower, as cool air may help reduce airway swelling more effectively [2, 3, 4]. In summary, while steam from a shower has been a traditional home remedy for croup, current evidence does not support its effectiveness, and safer, more effective treatments are available [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. If your child is experiencing severe symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, you should seek medical attention immediately [0, 2, 3].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01775-of-07168.116288.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04356-of-07168.128585.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04356-of-07168.128585.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02974-of-07168.47901.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03214-of-07168.58800.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04356-of-07168.128585.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01734-of-07168.136528.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02752-of-07168.67484.md_2', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06598-of-07168.143736.md_3', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05121-of-07168.126188.md_2']",inconsistent_helpful_vs_harmful_128,unhelpful

Right?,helpful,"Minoxidil is indeed an effective treatment for hair loss and is widely recognized for its ability to both prevent further hair loss and stimulate hair regrowth in many individuals. It is one of the few hair loss prevention products that is backed by scientific research and clinical trials, and it has been shown to stop the loss of hair follicles as well as stimulate the regrowth of hair, particularly in cases of male and female pattern baldness [1, 2]. Minoxidil works as a vasodilator, increasing blood flow to the scalp, which allows hair follicles to receive more nutrients and oxygen, thereby supporting healthy hair growth [0, 1, 4]. The effectiveness of minoxidil has been demonstrated in studies, with one primary study showing that men who used a 5% minoxidil solution experienced a 55% increase in hair regrowth within five months, compared to a 25% increase for those using a 2% solution [3]. Minoxidil is available in various forms, including liquid, foam, and aerosol, and is approved by the FDA for over-the-counter use at concentrations up to 5% [1, 2]. However, it is important to note that minoxidil is not a cure for hair loss, and its effects are only maintained with continued use; stopping treatment will typically result in the resumption of hair loss [2, 4]. Additionally, while minoxidil is effective for many people, it may not work for everyone, and its ability to restore hair in areas of complete baldness, such as a receding hairline, is limited [4]. In summary, the belief that minoxidil cannot treat hair loss is incorrect. Minoxidil is a proven, effective option for many individuals experiencing hair loss, especially when used consistently and as directed [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01507-of-07168.35872.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01882-of-07168.117431.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01882-of-07168.117431.md_7', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01882-of-07168.117431.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01968-of-07168.100593.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00494-of-07168.54286.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01507-of-07168.35872.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00494-of-07168.54286.md_1', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04723-of-07168.435.md_2', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03508-of-07168.34859.md_1']",inconsistent_helpful_vs_harmful_129,helpful

Right?,helpful,"The belief that L-theanine supplements can reduce stress and anxiety is supported by a substantial body of scientific evidence. Multiple studies have demonstrated that L-theanine promotes relaxation and reduces anxiety without causing sedation or drowsiness, making it distinct from many prescription anxiolytics that often have sedative side effects [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. L-theanine works by increasing the production of GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain that is associated with relaxation and reduced anxiety [0, 1, 4]. This mechanism helps to dampen sensations of restlessness and anxiety, supporting feelings of calm and contentment [4]. Research has shown that supplementation with L-theanine leads to significant increases in alpha brain wave activity, which is associated with a relaxed but alert mental state [1, 2, 4]. For example, a 2016 study found that a 200mg dose of L-theanine significantly reduced participants' response to stressful stimuli and increased alpha brain wave activity, especially in individuals with higher baseline anxiety [1, 4]. Furthermore, L-theanine has been shown to reduce both the mental and physical symptoms of stress, such as lowering heart rate and blood pressure in response to stressful situations [0, 2, 3, 4]. Several studies have reported that L-theanine supplementation can prevent the abrupt rise in blood pressure that some people experience under stress, and can also reduce heart rate increases associated with stress [0, 3, 4]. In addition, L-theanine has been found to lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which can otherwise impair memory and cognitive function [2, 4]. Clinical research also supports the use of L-theanine for reducing anxiety in specific populations, such as individuals with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, where supplementation led to significant reductions in anxiety symptoms [2, 3]. In summary, the claim that L-theanine supplements can reduce stress and anxiety is well-supported by scientific studies and clinical evidence, making it a credible and effective option for those seeking natural ways to manage stress and anxiety [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00498-of-07168.54836.md_23', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02978-of-07168.39832.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00498-of-07168.54836.md_26', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02978-of-07168.39832.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00568-of-07168.89598.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01023-of-07168.62264.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01845-of-07168.44388.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00630-of-07168.78305.md_4', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00199-of-07168.43173.md_1', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05650-of-07168.62751.md_3']",inconsistent_helpful_vs_harmful_131,helpful

The rationale behind steam inhalation is that inhaling warm, moist air may help to loosen mucus, soothe irritated airways, and relieve congestion, thereby making it easier to breathe [0, 2]. However, the scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of steam inhalation for treating the common cold is limited and equivocal. A Cochrane review specifically examining steam inhalation for the common cold found the evidence to be inconclusive, meaning that it did not clearly demonstrate a benefit [0, 2, 4]. Furthermore, a recent large primary care trial found that advising patients to inhale steam twice daily for a range of respiratory tract infections, including the common cold, did not provide significant symptomatic benefit compared to usual care [0, 1, 2, 4]. In this trial, steam inhalation was not effective in improving most symptoms, although it did reduce headache in some cases [4]. Additionally, there are potential risks associated with steam inhalation. The same studies reported that a small proportion of individuals (about 1 in 50) who used steam inhalation experienced mild thermal injuries, such as scalding, although these were generally not severe enough to require medical attention [1, 3, 4]. Because of the lack of clear benefit and the risk of mild injury, experts now advise that clinicians should probably not recommend steam inhalation as a routine treatment for acute respiratory infections like the common cold [1, 3, 4]. In summary, while steam inhalation is a common home remedy believed to help with cold symptoms by loosening mucus and soothing airways, current research does not support its effectiveness for the common cold, and there is a small risk of mild thermal injury [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore, it is not generally recommended as a treatment for the common cold in clinical practice.","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03869-of-07168.101094.md_7', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03839-of-07168.146775.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04509-of-07168.124062.md_7', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03839-of-07168.146775.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04509-of-07168.124062.md_6', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03839-of-07168.146775.md_4', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03869-of-07168.101094.md_6', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02956-of-07168.116963.md_3', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04404-of-07168.98125.md_3', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02743-of-07168.84994.md_3']",inconsistent_helpful_vs_harmful_132,unhelpful

The correct way to remove a tick is to use fine-tipped tweezers or forceps to grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible and pull steadily upward without twisting or squeezing the tick’s body [1, 2, 3, 4]. After removal, the area should be cleaned with soap and water or an antiseptic wipe [1, 3, 4].

Experiments have shown that for vinegar to soften a fish bone, the bone must be soaked in vinegar for several hours, which is not achievable by simply drinking vinegar, as the contact time in the throat is too brief to have any effect on the bone’s hardness [1, 2, 4]. Therefore, drinking vinegar will not achieve the purpose of softening or dissolving a fish bone stuck in the throat [1, 2, 4]. Moreover, drinking vinegar can actually be harmful. Acetic acid in vinegar can irritate the pharyngeal mucosa, causing acute congestion, aggravating inflammation, and potentially leading to stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, or even acute gastritis if consumed in large amounts [2]. There have also been reports of caustic burns to the esophagus from drinking undiluted vinegar in attempts to dislodge fish bones, highlighting the potential dangers of this practice [3]. Doctors and medical experts strongly advise against using vinegar or other home remedies such as swallowing rice or bread to force the bone down, as these methods can make the situation worse by pushing the bone deeper, causing infection, airway perforation, or even life-threatening complications like aortic rupture [0, 1, 4]. The recommended action if a fish bone is stuck in your throat is to seek medical attention promptly, rather than attempting to dissolve or dislodge it with vinegar or food [0, 1, 2, 4].

In these studies, participants wore copper bracelets and other control devices over several months, and their pain, disability, medication use, and inflammation markers were carefully monitored. The results consistently demonstrated that copper bracelets provided no meaningful therapeutic benefit beyond a placebo effect [0, 1, 2, 3]. The perceived benefit that some users report is likely due to the placebo effect, where believing in the treatment can alter the perception of pain, or due to natural fluctuations in symptoms over time rather than any direct action of the copper itself [0, 2]. Additionally, the idea that copper can be absorbed through the skin to alleviate arthritis symptoms is not supported by scientific evidence [2]. Therefore, while copper bracelets are generally safe to wear as decorative items, they should not be relied upon for managing arthritis pain, and individuals are encouraged to seek proven medical treatments for their condition [0, 1, 2, 3].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01759-of-07168.133166.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03219-of-07168.94259.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00487-of-07168.140865.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00866-of-07168.143736.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00866-of-07168.143736.md_6', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00866-of-07168.143736.md_4', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03546-of-07168.130262.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01759-of-07168.133166.md_2', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03653-of-07168.45563.md_4', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05932-of-07168.58032.md_0']",inconsistent_helpful_vs_harmful_139,unhelpful
qid_143,inconsistent,tylenol osteoarthritis,I've heard that Tylenol manages the symptoms of osteoarthritis. I don't believe that. Right?,helpful,"Your skepticism is understandable, but the evidence shows that Tylenol (acetaminophen) is indeed effective for managing the symptoms of osteoarthritis, particularly mild to moderate pain. Multiple reputable sources recommend acetaminophen as a first-line treatment for osteoarthritis pain. For example, the American College of Rheumatology and the American Geriatrics Society recommend acetaminophen (Tylenol) as a first-line treatment for osteoarthritis, and it can provide significant relief of arthritis pain without many of the side effects associated with prescription drugs, as long as the recommended dose is not exceeded [3, 4]. Clinical guidelines and medical experts also support the use of acetaminophen for osteoarthritis. Studies have shown that acetaminophen is effective in managing osteoarthritis symptoms in patients with mild to moderate pain [0, 1, 2]. However, it is important to note that taking more than the recommended dosage can cause liver damage, so it should be used as directed [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. In summary, Tylenol (acetaminophen) is widely recognized as an effective option for managing osteoarthritis pain, especially for those with mild to moderate symptoms [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00146-of-07168.128040.md_7', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00146-of-07168.128040.md_8', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.07121-of-07168.132517.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00330-of-07168.18716.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00363-of-07168.111706.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00398-of-07168.28739.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00398-of-07168.28739.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00252-of-07168.61172.md_0', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03192-of-07168.142130.md_1', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03929-of-07168.148346.md_1']",inconsistent_helpful_vs_harmful_143,helpful
qid_146,inconsistent,vitamin d asthma attacks,I've heard that vitamin D supplements can improve the management of asthma. I don't believe that. Right?,helpful,"Current scientific evidence suggests that vitamin D supplements can indeed improve the management of asthma, particularly by reducing the risk of severe asthma attacks. Multiple studies and meta-analyses have shown that taking vitamin D supplements in addition to standard asthma medication is likely to reduce the frequency and severity of asthma exacerbations, especially in individuals with low baseline levels of vitamin D [2, 4]. For example, pooled data from several clinical trials involving 955 asthma patients demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation resulted in a 30% reduction in the rate of asthma attacks requiring treatment with steroid tablets or injections, and a 50% reduction in attacks requiring emergency department attendance or hospitalization (from 6% to 3%) [1, 4]. The protective effect was particularly strong and statistically significant in participants who had low vitamin D levels at the start of the studies, with a 55% reduction in the rate of severe asthma exacerbations in this group [1, 4]. However, no statistically significant benefit was observed among those who already had higher vitamin D levels at baseline [1, 4]. The mechanism by which vitamin D is thought to help involves boosting immune responses to respiratory viruses and reducing harmful airway inflammation, both of which are key factors in triggering asthma attacks [0, 4]. Importantly, the dosages of vitamin D used in these studies were found to be safe, with no significant side effects such as changes in calcium levels or kidney stones reported [0, 3]. It is worth noting that most of the available evidence comes from studies involving adults with mild to moderate asthma, and people with severe asthma or children were underrepresented in these studies. Therefore, while the results are promising, they may not be fully generalizable to all asthma patients, and further research is ongoing [1, 4]. In summary, the current body of evidence supports the idea that vitamin D supplementation can improve asthma management, particularly for those with low vitamin D levels, by reducing the risk and severity of asthma attacks [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00564-of-07168.90406.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00100-of-07168.122967.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00303-of-07168.65790.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00564-of-07168.90406.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00100-of-07168.122967.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00032-of-07168.131764.md_10', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00699-of-07168.80284.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00699-of-07168.80284.md_4', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04772-of-07168.84155.md_9', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04772-of-07168.84155.md_8']",inconsistent_helpful_vs_harmful_146,helpful
qid_149,inconsistent,hip osteoarthritis at-home exercises,I've heard that at-home exercises will manage hip osteoarthritis pain. I don't believe that. Right?,helpful,"Your belief that at-home exercises cannot manage hip osteoarthritis pain is not supported by current evidence. In fact, at-home exercises are considered highly effective for managing hip osteoarthritis pain and improving joint function. Exercise increases blood flow, brings oxygen and nutrients to the cartilage, and helps joints work better and last longer, which can relieve symptoms such as pain, stiffness, and fatigue associated with osteoarthritis [0, 1]. There are several types of at-home exercises that are particularly beneficial for hip osteoarthritis. These include aerobic exercises like walking and biking, strengthening exercises such as chair stands and wall squats, and range-of-motion exercises that help ease stiffness and restore flexibility [0, 1, 2]. For example, you can perform simple strengthening exercises at home, such as sitting in a chair and standing up without using your hands, or wall squats, both of which help support and stabilize the hip joint [0, 1, 2]. Range-of-motion exercises, like gentle hip stretches and knee-to-chest movements, can also be done at home to improve flexibility and reduce discomfort [0, 2]. Low-impact activities such as walking, biking, swimming, and elliptical training are recommended, and you should start slowly, gradually increasing the duration and intensity to avoid injury [0, 1]. The goal is to work up to 30 minutes of exercise five times per week [0, 1]. Additionally, research shows that exercise is the most effective non-drug treatment for osteoarthritis, and it can even help prevent further joint deterioration and make daily activities easier [0, 1]. Core exercises, which can also be performed at home, are important for stabilizing weight-bearing structures and reducing stress on the hips [3, 4]. In summary, at-home exercises are not only effective but are a cornerstone of managing hip osteoarthritis pain and improving quality of life [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00945-of-07168.54620.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00945-of-07168.54620.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00945-of-07168.54620.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00083-of-07168.114295.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00491-of-07168.131203.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00867-of-07168.65223.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00630-of-07168.35835.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00145-of-07168.35543.md_1', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04196-of-07168.126836.md_1', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04196-of-07168.126836.md_13']",inconsistent_helpful_vs_harmful_149,helpful
