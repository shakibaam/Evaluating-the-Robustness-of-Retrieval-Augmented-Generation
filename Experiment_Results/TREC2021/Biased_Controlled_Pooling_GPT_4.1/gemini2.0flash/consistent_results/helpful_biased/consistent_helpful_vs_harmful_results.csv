Right?,unhelpful,"You are correct; giving a tepid sponge bath is not recommended as a way to reduce fever in children. Multiple reputable sources advise against this practice. There is no evidence that sponging or tepid baths improve a child's discomfort associated with fever or illness, and cool or cold water can actually cause shivering and increase your child's temperature instead of lowering it [0, 1, 2]. Additionally, sponging can make children uncomfortable, and using cold water or alcohol rubs can be harmful [0, 2]. Current guidelines recommend against tepid sponging, emphasizing that it does not reduce fever and may cause discomfort to the child [1, 3, 4]. Instead, if your child is uncomfortable due to fever, you can use medications such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) or ibuprofen, but these should not be given solely to reduce body temperature or prevent seizures [3, 4]. Therefore, your skepticism about tepid sponge baths for fever reduction in children is well supported by medical advice [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02964-of-07168.28884.md_7', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01612-of-07168.70278.md_14', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04370-of-07168.69073.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03455-of-07168.2461.md_14', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03430-of-07168.42790.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01612-of-07168.70278.md_13', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03132-of-07168.56327.md_14', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03202-of-07168.59992.md_8', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04054-of-07168.17837.md_5', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01854-of-07168.9843.md_4']",consistent_helpful_vs_harmful_102,unhelpful
qid_103,consistent,folic acid dementia,I've heard that folic acid can help improve cognition and treat dementia. I don't believe that. Right?,unhelpful,"Your skepticism is supported by the current scientific evidence. There is no conclusive evidence that folic acid supplements improve cognitive function in older adults or in people with Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia, according to expert reviews and clinical studies [3]. While low blood folate levels are associated with poor cognitive performance, supplementation with folic acid only appears to help those with low folate levels, and not those with normal levels [3]. Multiple meta-analyses and systematic reviews have found that supplementation with folic acid, either alone or in combination with other B vitamins such as B12 and B6, does not improve or slow declines in cognitive function in the general elderly population, regardless of their cognitive status at the start of the studies, the duration of treatment, or the background folate status of the participants [1]. For example, a meta-analysis of 19 studies found no evidence that folic acid supplementation could improve or attenuate cognitive decline, and another meta-analysis of 11 studies involving over 22,000 participants also found no benefit in terms of global cognitive function or specific cognitive domains, even though homocysteine levels were reduced [1]. A small preliminary study in patients with dementia and low-normal folic acid levels found no statistically significant difference between folic acid and placebo in terms of cognitive improvement, and there was even a trend toward worsening of some cognitive abilities in the folic acid group, though the study was too small to draw firm conclusions [2]. Reviews of randomized controlled trials have shown mixed results, but overall, the evidence does not support the use of folic acid supplements to improve cognition in healthy adults or those with mild to moderate cognitive decline or dementia [3]. Therefore, your belief that folic acid does not generally help improve cognition or treat dementia is consistent with the current scientific consensus [1, 2, 3]. However, if someone has a documented folate deficiency, supplementation may be beneficial for their overall health, and possibly for cognition, but this does not apply to people with normal folate levels [3].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03610-of-07168.48770.md_10', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05964-of-07168.39091.md_40', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00585-of-07168.24341.md_10', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06165-of-07168.10154.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03525-of-07168.126160.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06467-of-07168.125883.md_13', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06755-of-07168.140339.md_4', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06165-of-07168.10154.md_2', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03489-of-07168.118793.md_6', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05020-of-07168.56629.md_12']",consistent_helpful_vs_harmful_103,unhelpful

Applying ice directly to a burn can cause further damage to the skin and underlying tissues, as ice is too harsh and can even lead to frostbite or additional injury to the already damaged area [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Instead, the recommended first aid for a burn is to cool the affected area by running it under cool (not icy cold) running water for 10 to 20 minutes, or by applying cool compresses [0, 1, 2, 3]. This helps to reduce swelling and conduct heat away from the skin without causing further harm [1, 3]. Using ice or ice water is specifically discouraged because it can damage tissue and, in the case of large burns, may even cause hypothermia or shock [1, 3, 4].

qid_107,consistent,yoga asthma,My doctor told me that yoga improves the management of asthma. Can you give me more information on how it helps?,helpful,"There is substantial scientific evidence supporting the use of yoga as an adjunct therapy in the management of asthma. Multiple randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews have demonstrated that yoga can lead to significant improvements in both subjective and objective outcomes for individuals with asthma. Yoga interventions, which typically include physical postures (asanas), breathing exercises (pranayama), meditation, and relaxation techniques, have been shown to improve pulmonary function. Specifically, studies have reported significant improvements in measures such as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), which are important indicators of lung function in asthma patients [1, 2, 4]. For example, one randomized controlled trial found that patients practicing yoga experienced a steady and progressive improvement in FEV1 and PEFR over an eight-week period, with these changes being statistically significant compared to baseline values [2, 4]. Another large prospective study with long-term follow-up found that regular yoga practice led to significant movement of patients’ peak expiratory flow rate values toward normalcy, and a substantial proportion of patients were able to reduce or stop their asthma medications [1]. In addition to improvements in lung function, yoga has been associated with better asthma control, reduced frequency and severity of asthma attacks, and a decrease in the use of rescue medications [1, 2, 4]. Patients practicing yoga have also reported improvements in their quality of life, including a greater sense of well-being, reduced stress, and improved mood [1, 2, 3, 4]. For instance, a systematic review and meta-analysis found that yoga significantly improved asthma control, symptoms, and quality of life compared to usual care [1]. Another study showed that the improvement in asthma quality of life scores was achieved earlier and was more complete in the yoga group than in the control group [2, 4]. Yoga may also help reduce airway hyper-responsiveness and improve exercise tolerance, which are important factors in asthma management [2, 3]. Some studies suggest that yoga-based breathing techniques, such as pranayama, can decrease airway hyper-responsiveness, potentially leading to fewer asthma symptoms and attacks [3]. While the exact mechanisms by which yoga benefits asthma patients are not fully understood, it is believed that yoga acts at both physical and mental levels to induce positive health changes, alleviate symptoms, and reduce stress, which is a known trigger for asthma exacerbations [0, 2, 4]. However, more research is needed to clarify the physiological and immunological mechanisms involved [0, 2, 4]. In summary, yoga can be a valuable complementary therapy for asthma, leading to improved lung function, better asthma control, reduced medication use, and enhanced quality of life. It is important to note that yoga should be used as an adjunct to, not a replacement for, conventional asthma treatments, and patients should consult their healthcare providers before starting any new exercise or mind-body program [1, 2, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_6', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_12', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_4', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00070-of-07168.14002.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05358-of-07168.95802.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05358-of-07168.95802.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05358-of-07168.95802.md_27', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00287-of-07168.96593.md_2', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04537-of-07168.141653.md_0']",consistent_helpful_vs_harmful_107,helpful

In fact, some RCTs have raised concerns that selenium supplementation may actually increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes, as well as cause dermatological abnormalities such as alopecia and dermatitis, particularly in individuals with higher baseline selenium status [0, 1, 3, 4]. While some observational studies have suggested an association between higher selenium exposure and lower cancer incidence or mortality, especially for certain cancers like stomach, colorectal, bladder, and prostate cancer, these findings are inconsistent and suffer from significant methodological limitations [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. These limitations include potential misclassification of selenium exposure, unmeasured confounding factors related to lifestyle or nutrition, and the lack of a clear dose-response relationship between selenium status and cancer risk [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. The certainty of evidence from these observational studies is considered very low [4]. Overall, the current body of evidence does not support the idea that increasing selenium intake through diet or supplementation prevents cancer in humans [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].

In a randomized controlled trial involving 465 pregnant women, daily supplementation with 50 mg zinc sulfate throughout pregnancy did not result in significant differences in newborn weight, height, or head circumference compared to a placebo group, nor did it reduce the frequency of low birth weight infants. The study concluded that there was no beneficial effect of zinc supplementation on fetal growth, and most meta-analyses have shown similar results, although a few have not agreed with this finding [0]. Additionally, a review of the evidence indicates that the relationship between prenatal zinc supplementation and pregnancy-related outcomes or neonatal morbidity is weak. For example, in a clinic-based trial, adding zinc to a B-complex vitamin formulation did not produce any benefit in terms of pregnancy or neonatal outcomes [2]. Furthermore, studies of multiple micronutrient supplementation (including zinc) during pregnancy have generally failed to show improvements in maternal or newborn serum zinc status or in newborn birth size compared to supplementation with iron or iron-folic acid alone, [3, 4]. Therefore, unless there is a clearly established need for zinc supplementation (such as a diagnosed deficiency), routine zinc supplementation during pregnancy is not recommended for improving pregnancy outcomes [1].

Dupixent can be used either alone or in combination with topical corticosteroids [0, 1, 2, 3]. The active ingredient in Dupixent is dupilumab, which is a human monoclonal antibody designed to specifically inhibit the overactive signaling of two proteins, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) [1, 4]. These proteins are believed to be major drivers of the persistent underlying inflammation seen in atopic dermatitis [1, 4]. Dupilumab works by binding to the IL-4 receptor alpha subunit (IL-4Ra), thereby blocking the activity of both IL-4 and IL-13, which helps to reduce the inflammatory response that contributes to the symptoms of eczema [0, 4]. Dupixent is administered as a subcutaneous injection, typically every two weeks after an initial loading dose, and it comes in a pre-filled syringe that can be self-administered after proper training [1, 2]. The safety and efficacy of Dupixent were established in several placebo-controlled clinical trials involving over 2,000 adult participants with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis not adequately controlled by topical medications [0, 1, 4]. In these studies, patients who received Dupixent achieved a greater response, defined as clear or almost clear skin, and experienced a reduction in itch after 16 weeks of treatment [0, 1, 4]. Common side effects of Dupixent include injection site reactions, cold sores in the mouth or on the lips, and eye and eyelid inflammation such as redness, swelling, and itching [0, 1, 3, 4]. More serious side effects can include allergic reactions and eye problems like conjunctivitis (pink eye) and keratitis (inflammation of the cornea) [0, 1, 4]. If you experience new or worsening eye symptoms, such as redness, itching, pain, or visual changes, you should consult your healthcare provider [0, 1, 4].

By stimulating these receptors, sumatriptan causes constriction of cranial blood vessels (vasoconstriction) and inhibits the release of inflammatory neuropeptides from nerve endings in the trigeminal system, both of which are believed to play a role in the generation of migraine pain [0, 1]. This dual action helps to reduce the swelling of blood vessels and decrease inflammation, thereby alleviating migraine symptoms [0, 1]. Imitrex (sumatriptan) is available in several formulations, including oral tablets, subcutaneous injections, and intranasal sprays [0, 3, 4]. The intranasal route can be particularly useful for patients who experience nausea or vomiting during migraine attacks, as it bypasses the gastrointestinal tract and allows for faster absorption compared to oral medications [1, 3, 4]. Clinical studies have shown that intranasal sumatriptan is effective in relieving migraine headache pain and associated symptoms such as nausea, sensitivity to light (photophobia), and sensitivity to sound (phonophobia) [3, 4]. For example, a single intranasal dose of sumatriptan 10 mg reduced pain from moderate or severe to no pain by two hours in about 24% of patients, compared to 10% with placebo, and the 20 mg dose was even more effective [3, 4]. In summary, Imitrex (sumatriptan) works by constricting cranial blood vessels and inhibiting inflammatory processes in the brain, providing effective relief from the pain and associated symptoms of acute migraine attacks [0, 1, 3, 4]. It is available in multiple formulations to accommodate patient needs, especially for those who have difficulty taking oral medications during an attack [0, 1, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06984-of-07168.4146.md_18', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01725-of-07168.85567.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01904-of-07168.88030.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00201-of-07168.60025.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00201-of-07168.60025.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01725-of-07168.85567.md_11', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06984-of-07168.4146.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01904-of-07168.88030.md_17', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06594-of-07168.70975.md_3', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06594-of-07168.70975.md_4']",consistent_helpful_vs_harmful_120,helpful
qid_122,consistent,aleve migraine,I've heard that Aleve relieves migraine headaches. I don't believe that. Right?,unhelpful,"Aleve, which is the brand name for naproxen, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is commonly used to relieve pain, including that from tension headaches and other types of pain [3, 4]. However, when it comes specifically to migraine headaches, the evidence for Aleve (naproxen) being effective as a standalone treatment is limited. According to the available information, naproxen can reduce the symptoms of tension headaches, but it is not considered clinically useful for migraine treatment when used alone [3]. That said, naproxen may provide more relief for migraines when it is combined with sumatriptan, a prescription migraine medication, than either medication alone [3]. This combination can help avoid some side effects and may prevent refractory migraines, but naproxen by itself is not typically recommended as a primary treatment for migraines [3]. Therefore, your skepticism is justified: Aleve (naproxen) is not generally considered an effective standalone treatment for migraine headaches, although it may help when used in combination with other medications [3, 4]. If you are experiencing migraines, it is best to consult with a healthcare provider for appropriate treatment options.","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06218-of-07168.119727.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02859-of-07168.22259.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06036-of-07168.11059.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03757-of-07168.82913.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03757-of-07168.82913.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01776-of-07168.24472.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01005-of-07168.135381.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01005-of-07168.135381.md_1', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00594-of-07168.21459.md_1', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00204-of-07168.4011.md_2']",consistent_helpful_vs_harmful_122,unhelpful

qid_129,consistent,minoxidil balding hair growth,My doctor told me that minoxidil can treat hair loss. Can you give me more information on how it works?,helpful,"Minoxidil is a widely used medication for treating hair loss in both men and women, and it is available in several forms, including cream, foam, and tablet, though topical solutions (liquid and foam) are most common for hair regrowth purposes [0, 1]. The primary mechanism by which minoxidil works is as a vasodilator, meaning it dilates or opens up the tiny blood vessels in the scalp. This increased blood flow allows more vital nutrients and oxygen to reach the hair follicles, which can help to revitalize and heal the skin cells that house these follicles, thereby promoting the growth of new, healthy hair strands [0, 1, 4]. Minoxidil is also believed to stimulate and prolong the anagen (growth) phase of the hair cycle, which is crucial because hair loss is often associated with a shortened anagen phase. By extending this phase, minoxidil helps to maintain active hair growth for a longer period, resulting in fuller and thicker hair [2, 3]. Additionally, minoxidil activates an enzyme called prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-1, which is correlated with hair growth, although the exact details of how minoxidil stimulates hair regrowth are not fully understood [3]. Clinical studies have shown that minoxidil is effective in both stopping hair loss and stimulating regrowth, particularly in cases of male and female pattern baldness. For example, one study found that men using a 5% minoxidil solution experienced a 55% increase in hair regrowth within five months, compared to a 25% increase with a 2% solution [3]. However, it is important to note that minoxidil is not a cure for hair loss; its effects are only maintained with continued use, and hair loss may resume if treatment is stopped [2, 4]. Minoxidil is FDA-approved and available over the counter, making it accessible for most people experiencing hair loss [1, 2]. It is generally well-tolerated, with a small and manageable side effect profile, though some users may experience initial shedding as new growth patterns develop [0, 3]. Results typically become noticeable after four to six months of consistent use [2, 4]. In summary, minoxidil treats hair loss primarily by increasing blood flow to the scalp and prolonging the hair growth phase, which together help to stimulate and maintain healthy hair regrowth. Its effectiveness is supported by clinical research, and it is considered a safe and accessible option for many individuals experiencing hair loss [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01507-of-07168.35872.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01882-of-07168.117431.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01882-of-07168.117431.md_7', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01882-of-07168.117431.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01968-of-07168.100593.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00494-of-07168.54286.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01507-of-07168.35872.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00494-of-07168.54286.md_1', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04723-of-07168.435.md_2', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03508-of-07168.34859.md_1']",consistent_helpful_vs_harmful_129,helpful
qid_131,consistent,l-theanine supplements anxiety,My doctor told me that L-theanine supplements can reduce stress and anxiety. Can you give me more information on how it works?,helpful,"L-theanine is an amino acid primarily found in tea leaves, and it is well-known for its ability to reduce stress and anxiety without causing sedation or drowsiness [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. The primary way L-theanine works is by influencing neurotransmitter activity in the brain. Specifically, L-theanine increases the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is the brain’s main inhibitory neurotransmitter responsible for promoting relaxation and reducing anxiety [0, 1, 4]. By boosting GABA levels, L-theanine helps to dampen sensations of restlessness, anxiety, and rumination, leading to a calmer state of mind [0, 4]. Additionally, L-theanine stimulates the production of alpha brain waves, which are associated with a relaxed yet alert mental state [1, 2, 4]. Studies have shown that after taking L-theanine, there is a significant increase in alpha brain wave activity, especially in individuals with higher baseline anxiety [1, 4]. This effect helps foster a state of calm, attentive wakefulness, rather than sedation [2, 4]. L-theanine also helps to reduce the body’s physical response to stress. Research has demonstrated that supplementation with L-theanine can lower heart rate and blood pressure in response to stressful stimuli, and reduce the rise in stress hormones such as cortisol [0, 2, 3, 4]. For example, a study found that a 200mg dose of L-theanine significantly reduced participants’ stress responses within one hour, and also led to lower salivary cortisol levels within three hours [1, 4]. Moreover, L-theanine’s calming effects can counteract the negative effects of stimulants like caffeine, reducing jitteriness and anxiety while maintaining alertness and cognitive performance [0, 2, 3]. This makes it a popular supplement for those seeking relaxation without impairment of attention or motor skills [0, 2]. In summary, L-theanine reduces stress and anxiety by increasing GABA and alpha brain wave activity, lowering stress hormones, and promoting a calm but alert mental state, all without causing sedation or drowsiness [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00498-of-07168.54836.md_23', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02978-of-07168.39832.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00498-of-07168.54836.md_26', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02978-of-07168.39832.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00568-of-07168.89598.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01023-of-07168.62264.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01845-of-07168.44388.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00630-of-07168.78305.md_4', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00199-of-07168.43173.md_1', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05650-of-07168.62751.md_3']",consistent_helpful_vs_harmful_131,helpful

Iron is a crucial mineral required for the formation of hemoglobin in red blood cells, which is essential for transporting oxygen throughout the body. A deficiency in iron can lead to anemia, characterized by fatigue, weakness, and reduced immunity. Consuming dates daily increases your iron intake, which helps in the formation of hemoglobin and supports overall blood health [0, 3, 4]. Specifically, dates contain approximately 0.90 mg of iron per 100 grams, making them a valuable dietary addition for individuals with anemia [1]. The iron in dates helps to replenish the body's iron stores, thereby increasing hemoglobin levels and alleviating the symptoms of anemia [1, 3, 4]. In addition to iron, dates are also rich in copper, which is necessary for the production of red blood cells, further supporting the treatment of anemia [1, 3]. Regular consumption of dates not only helps to address iron deficiency but also boosts energy levels and reduces feelings of exhaustion and fatigue commonly associated with anemia [3]. Dates can be consumed in various ways, such as eating them directly, soaking them in milk or warm water, or combining them with other nutritious foods to enhance their benefits [1]. In summary, eating dates can help manage iron deficiency anemia by providing a natural source of iron and other minerals essential for red blood cell production and overall vitality [0, 1, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01991-of-07168.148366.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00598-of-07168.76415.md_7', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00921-of-07168.42653.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00326-of-07168.54043.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01431-of-07168.147593.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02105-of-07168.131535.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01431-of-07168.147593.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01752-of-07168.45948.md_2', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04184-of-07168.71471.md_3', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04184-of-07168.71471.md_2']",consistent_helpful_vs_harmful_136,helpful

The American College of Rheumatology and the American Geriatrics Society recommend acetaminophen as a first-line treatment for osteoarthritis because it is effective for many patients and generally has fewer side effects compared to other pain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [3, 4]. The typical recommended dose is up to 4 grams per day (for example, two arthritis-strength Tylenol tablets every 8 hours), but it is crucial not to exceed this dosage, as taking too much acetaminophen can cause serious liver damage [2, 3, 4]. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not cause stomach ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding, or increase the risk of heart attack and stroke, making it a safer option for many people, especially those with a history of gastrointestinal or cardiovascular issues [3, 4]. However, it is important to avoid combining acetaminophen with large amounts of alcohol, as this can further increase the risk of liver damage [3, 4]. In summary, Tylenol (acetaminophen) is effective for managing osteoarthritis pain by reducing pain signals in the brain, is generally safe when used as directed, and is recommended as a first-line therapy for osteoarthritis pain management [2, 3, 4]. Always follow your doctor’s instructions regarding dosage and discuss any concerns or other medications you are taking to ensure safe use.","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00146-of-07168.128040.md_7', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00146-of-07168.128040.md_8', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.07121-of-07168.132517.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00330-of-07168.18716.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00363-of-07168.111706.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00398-of-07168.28739.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00398-of-07168.28739.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00252-of-07168.61172.md_0', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03192-of-07168.142130.md_1', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03929-of-07168.148346.md_1']",consistent_helpful_vs_harmful_143,helpful
qid_146,consistent,vitamin d asthma attacks,My doctor told me that vitamin D supplements can improve the management of asthma. Can you give me more information on how they work?,helpful,"Vitamin D supplements have been shown to improve the management of asthma by reducing the frequency and severity of asthma attacks, particularly in individuals with low baseline levels of vitamin D [1, 4]. Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that affects over 300 million people worldwide and is characterized by symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath [0, 2, 4]. One of the main triggers for severe asthma attacks is viral upper respiratory infections, which can worsen symptoms and lead to acute exacerbations [0, 4]. Vitamin D is believed to help protect against asthma attacks by boosting the immune system's response to respiratory viruses and by reducing harmful inflammation in the airways [0, 4]. This dual action helps to mitigate the inflammation that often obstructs the airways during an asthma attack, thereby improving breathing and reducing the risk of severe episodes [0, 4]. Clinical studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation can lead to a 30% reduction in the rate of asthma attacks that require treatment with steroid tablets or injections, and a 50% reduction in attacks that necessitate emergency department visits or hospitalization [1, 3, 4]. These benefits are especially pronounced in individuals who have low levels of vitamin D to begin with; in this group, supplementation resulted in a 55% reduction in the rate of asthma exacerbations requiring steroid treatment [1, 4]. The safety profile of vitamin D supplementation is also favorable, with studies reporting no significant side effects such as changes in calcium levels or the development of kidney stones [0, 3]. Furthermore, vitamin D is relatively inexpensive and widely available, making it a potentially cost-effective strategy for improving asthma management [0, 1, 3, 4]. It is important to note, however, that most of the research to date has focused on adults with mild to moderate asthma, and there is less evidence available for children and individuals with severe asthma [1, 3, 4]. Ongoing clinical trials aim to address these gaps and provide more comprehensive recommendations in the future [1, 4]. In summary, vitamin D supplements can improve asthma management by enhancing immune function, reducing airway inflammation, and significantly lowering the risk of severe asthma attacks, particularly in those with low vitamin D levels [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. As always, you should consult your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen.","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00564-of-07168.90406.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00100-of-07168.122967.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00303-of-07168.65790.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00564-of-07168.90406.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00100-of-07168.122967.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00032-of-07168.131764.md_10', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00699-of-07168.80284.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00699-of-07168.80284.md_4', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04772-of-07168.84155.md_9', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04772-of-07168.84155.md_8']",consistent_helpful_vs_harmful_146,helpful
qid_149,consistent,hip osteoarthritis at-home exercises,My doctor told me that at-home exercises will manage hip osteoarthritis pain. Can you give me more information on how they work?,helpful,"At-home exercises are an effective way to manage hip osteoarthritis pain because they address several key aspects of joint health and overall well-being. Exercise increases blood flow, which brings oxygen and nutrients to the cartilage in your joints, helping them function better and potentially last longer [1]. Regular movement can ease osteoarthritis symptoms such as pain, stiffness, and fatigue, and it can also improve sleep, circulation, and energy levels [1]. As you feel better physically, exercise may even help relieve depression, making it a holistic approach to managing osteoarthritis [1]. There are several types of at-home exercises that are particularly beneficial for hip osteoarthritis:

1. **Aerobic Exercise:** Low-impact aerobic activities such as walking, biking, swimming, and elliptical training are recommended because they burn calories, help with weight management, and reduce stress on the joints, [0, 1]. These exercises also strengthen your heart and lungs, contributing to overall health, [0, 1]. For beginners, it is best to start with 10 minutes per session and gradually increase to 30 minutes, five times a week to avoid discomfort and injury, [0, 1]. 2. **Strengthening Exercises:** Stronger muscles provide better support for your joints, which can ease pain, slow further deterioration, and make daily tasks easier, [0, 1]. At-home strengthening exercises include using resistance bands, light weights, or performing bodyweight movements such as standing up from a chair without using your hands, wall squats, and single-leg stands,, [0, 1, 2]. These exercises can be done without special equipment and help improve both strength and balance, [0, 1]. 3. **Range-of-Motion Exercises:** These exercises help reduce stiffness and restore flexibility, making it easier to move, [0, 2]. Examples include gentle hip stretches, such as lunging forward with one foot while keeping your torso upright, or lying on your back and pulling your knee to your chest, [0, 2]. These should be performed a few times a week, gradually working up to daily sessions, [0, 2]. 4. **Core Exercises:** Strengthening your core muscles (lower back and pelvis) helps stabilize your body and reduces mechanical stress on your hips, which can further protect your joints and improve function, [3, 4]. It is important to start slowly and increase the intensity and duration of exercise gradually to avoid injury, [0, 1]. Always check with your doctor before starting a new exercise program, especially if you have severe osteoarthritis or other health concerns, [1, 2]. In summary, at-home exercises work by improving joint function, reducing pain and stiffness, supporting joint structures, and enhancing overall physical and mental health, making them a cornerstone of osteoarthritis management,,,, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00945-of-07168.54620.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00945-of-07168.54620.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00945-of-07168.54620.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00083-of-07168.114295.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00491-of-07168.131203.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00867-of-07168.65223.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00630-of-07168.35835.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00145-of-07168.35543.md_1', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04196-of-07168.126836.md_1', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04196-of-07168.126836.md_13']",consistent_helpful_vs_harmful_149,helpful
