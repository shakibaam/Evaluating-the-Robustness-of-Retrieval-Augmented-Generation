Right?,unhelpful,"You are correct; giving a tepid sponge bath is not recommended as a way to reduce fever in children. Multiple reputable sources advise against this practice. There is no evidence that sponging or tepid baths improve a child's discomfort associated with fever or illness, and using cool or cold water can actually cause shivering and increase your child's temperature instead of lowering it [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Additionally, sponge baths can make children uncomfortable, and the use of rubbing alcohol in baths is especially dangerous as it can be absorbed through the skin or inhaled, leading to serious health problems such as coma [0, 2]. Current guidelines emphasize that tepid sponging is no longer recommended for managing fever in children [1, 3, 4]. Instead, focus on keeping your child comfortable, offering fluids, and using medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen if your child is distressed, but not solely to reduce body temperature [3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02964-of-07168.28884.md_7', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01612-of-07168.70278.md_14', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04370-of-07168.69073.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03455-of-07168.2461.md_14', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03430-of-07168.42790.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01612-of-07168.70278.md_13', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03132-of-07168.56327.md_14', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03202-of-07168.59992.md_8', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03430-of-07168.42790_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03455-of-07168.2461_fsap_interq_03_examples']",consistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_102,fsap_interq_03_examples,unhelpful
qid_103,consistent,folic acid dementia,I've heard that folic acid can help improve cognition and treat dementia. I don't believe that. Right?,unhelpful,"Your skepticism is supported by the current scientific evidence. There is no conclusive evidence that folic acid supplements improve cognitive function in older adults or in people with Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia [3]. While low folate blood levels are associated with poor cognitive performance, supplementation with folic acid is only potentially helpful for those with low folate levels, and not for people with normal levels [3]. Reviews of randomized, controlled trials have shown mixed results regarding the benefits of folic acid supplements on cognitive function in both healthy adults and those with mild to moderate cognitive decline or dementia [3]. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have also found no evidence that supplementation with folic acid, alone or in combination with vitamins B12 and B6, improves or slows the decline of cognitive function in aged participants, regardless of their cognitive status at the outset, study duration, or background folate status [1]. Even when homocysteine levels were significantly reduced by supplementation, no benefits were observed in global cognitive function or specific cognitive domains [1]. Some commentary suggests that certain subgroups, such as those with high homocysteine or low vitamin status, might benefit, but these findings are not consistent or robust enough to support general recommendations [1]. A small preliminary study specifically examining folic acid supplementation in patients with dementia and low-normal folic acid levels found no statistically significant difference in cognitive outcomes between those receiving folic acid and those receiving placebo. There was even a trend toward worsening of some cognitive abilities in the folic acid group, though the sample size was very small and the results were not definitive [2]. Therefore, based on the current evidence, folic acid supplementation does not appear to be an effective treatment for improving cognition or treating dementia in the general population [1, 2, 3].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03610-of-07168.48770.md_10', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05964-of-07168.39091.md_40', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00585-of-07168.24341.md_10', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06165-of-07168.10154.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03525-of-07168.126160.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06467-of-07168.125883.md_13', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06755-of-07168.140339.md_4', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06165-of-07168.10154.md_2', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01840-of-07168.56677_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01149-of-07168.56930_fsap_interq_03_examples']",consistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_103,fsap_interq_03_examples,unhelpful

Applying ice directly to a burn can cause further damage to the skin and underlying tissue, as ice is too harsh and can even lead to frostbite or additional injury to the affected area [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Instead, the recommended first aid for a burn is to cool the area by running it under cool (not icy cold) running water for 10 to 20 minutes or until the pain subsides [0, 1, 2, 3]. This helps to conduct heat away from the skin and reduce swelling without causing further harm [1, 3]. Using ice or ice water is specifically discouraged because it can damage tissue and, in the case of large burns, may even cause hypothermia or shock [1, 3, 4].

qid_107,consistent,yoga asthma,My doctor told me that yoga improves the management of asthma. Can you give me more information on how it helps?,helpful,"There is substantial scientific evidence supporting the use of yoga as an adjunct therapy in the management of asthma. Multiple randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews have demonstrated that yoga can lead to significant improvements in both subjective and objective outcomes for people with asthma. Yoga interventions, which typically include physical postures (asanas), breathing exercises (pranayama), meditation, and relaxation techniques, have been shown to improve pulmonary function. Specifically, studies have reported significant improvements in measures such as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), which are important indicators of lung function in asthma patients [1, 2, 4]. For example, one randomized controlled trial found a steady and progressive improvement in FEV1 and PEFR in the yoga group compared to baseline values, indicating better airway function [2, 4]. Another large prospective study found that regular yoga practice led to significant movement of patientsâ€™ peak expiratory flow rate values toward normalcy, and a substantial proportion of patients were able to reduce or stop their asthma medications [1]. In addition to objective improvements in lung function, yoga has been shown to enhance asthma-related quality of life. Participants in yoga interventions often report a greater sense of well-being, reduced frequency and severity of asthma attacks, and decreased use of rescue medications [1, 2, 4]. Improvements in quality of life scores have been observed to be both earlier and more complete in yoga groups compared to control groups receiving only conventional care [2, 4]. Furthermore, yoga has been associated with reductions in airway hyper-responsiveness and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, which are common triggers for asthma symptoms [2, 3]. Yoga may also have beneficial effects on psychological factors that can influence asthma, such as stress and mood. Mindfulness-based yoga interventions have been shown to significantly reduce perceived stress and improve mood subscales in asthma patients, which can contribute to better overall asthma control [0, 3]. Since asthma is considered a psychosomatic illness influenced by both physical and mental factors, the mind-body approach of yoga is thought to help by alleviating symptoms at both levels [0, 4]. While the exact mechanisms by which yoga improves asthma are not fully understood, it is believed that the combination of physical postures, controlled breathing, and relaxation helps to reduce airway inflammation, improve respiratory muscle strength, and decrease stress-related triggers [0, 2, 4]. However, more research is needed to clarify the physiological and immunological pathways involved [2, 4]. In summary, adding yoga to conventional asthma management can lead to measurable improvements in lung function, quality of life, reduction in medication use, and psychological well-being, making it a valuable complementary therapy for asthma patients [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_6', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_12', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_4', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00070-of-07168.14002.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05358-of-07168.95802.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05358-of-07168.95802.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05358-of-07168.95802.md_27', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03748-of-07168.66985_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01528-of-07168.45908_fsap_interq_03_examples']",consistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_107,fsap_interq_03_examples,helpful

While some observational studies have suggested an association between higher selenium exposure and lower cancer incidence or mortality, especially for certain cancers like stomach, colorectal, bladder, and prostate cancer, these studies have significant limitations [1, 3, 4]. The main issues include potential misclassification of selenium exposure, unmeasured confounding factors related to lifestyle or nutrition, and the lack of a clear dose-response relationship between selenium status and cancer risk [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. As a result, the certainty of evidence from these observational studies is considered very low [4]. Overall, the current consensus from comprehensive reviews and meta-analyses is that there is no evidence to suggest that increasing selenium intake through diet or supplementation prevents cancer in humans [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].

qid_118,consistent,dupixent eczema,My doctor told me that Dupixent can treat eczema. Can you give me more information on how it works?,helpful,"Dupixent (dupilumab) is a medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, particularly in patients whose condition is not adequately controlled by topical therapies or for whom such therapies are not advisable [0, 1, 2, 3]. Dupixent can be used either alone or in combination with topical corticosteroids [0, 1, 2, 3]. Dupixent is a human monoclonal antibody that works by specifically inhibiting the overactive signaling of two proteins, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13), which are believed to be major drivers of the persistent underlying inflammation in atopic dermatitis [1, 4]. The active ingredient, dupilumab, binds to the IL-4 receptor alpha subunit (IL-4Ra), thereby blocking the inflammatory response that contributes to the development and maintenance of eczema symptoms [0, 4]. The medication is administered as a subcutaneous injection, typically every two weeks after an initial loading dose, and comes in a pre-filled syringe that can be self-administered after proper training [1, 2]. The safety and efficacy of Dupixent were established in several placebo-controlled clinical trials involving over 2,000 adult participants with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis not adequately controlled by topical medications [0, 1, 4]. In these studies, patients who received Dupixent achieved a greater responseâ€”defined as clear or almost clear skinâ€”and experienced a reduction in itch after 16 weeks of treatment [0, 1, 4]. Common side effects of Dupixent include injection site reactions, cold sores in the mouth or on the lips, and eye and eyelid inflammation such as redness, swelling, and itching. More serious side effects can include allergic reactions and eye problems like conjunctivitis (pink eye) and keratitis (inflammation of the cornea).

qid_120,consistent,imitrex migraine,My doctor told me that the drug Imitrex (sumatriptan) can treat acute migraine attacks. Can you give me more information on how it works?,helpful,"Imitrex is the brand name for sumatriptan, a medication used for the acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults [0, 3, 4]. Sumatriptan belongs to a class of drugs known as triptans, which are specifically designed to relieve migraine symptoms once an attack has started, rather than to prevent future attacks [0, 3, 4]. The mechanism of action of sumatriptan involves its activity as an agonist at serotonin (5-HT1B/1D) receptors [0]. By stimulating these receptors, sumatriptan causes constriction of cranial blood vessels (vasoconstriction) and inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides from nerve endings in the trigeminal system, both of which are believed to play a role in the pathophysiology of migraine [0, 1]. This dual action helps to reduce the pain and associated symptoms of migraine, such as nausea, sensitivity to light (photophobia), and sensitivity to sound (phonophobia) [3, 4]. Imitrex (sumatriptan) is available in several formulations, including oral tablets, subcutaneous injections, and intranasal sprays [0, 3, 4]. The intranasal route is particularly useful for patients who experience nausea or vomiting during migraine attacks, as it bypasses the gastrointestinal tract and allows for more rapid absorption compared to oral formulations [1, 3, 4]. Clinical studies have shown that intranasal sumatriptan is effective in relieving migraine pain and associated symptoms within two hours of administration, with higher doses (such as 20 mg) providing greater efficacy but also a higher risk of mild or moderate adverse events [3, 4]. In summary, Imitrex (sumatriptan) treats acute migraine attacks by constricting cranial blood vessels and inhibiting inflammatory processes in the nervous system, leading to relief from headache pain and associated symptoms [0, 1, 3, 4]. It is not used for migraine prevention, but rather for aborting an ongoing attack, and is available in multiple formulations to accommodate patient needs and preferences [0, 1, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06984-of-07168.4146.md_18', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01725-of-07168.85567.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01904-of-07168.88030.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00201-of-07168.60025.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00201-of-07168.60025.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01725-of-07168.85567.md_11', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06984-of-07168.4146.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01904-of-07168.88030.md_17', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01725-of-07168.85567_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03853-of-07168.9476_fsap_interq_03_examples']",consistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_120,fsap_interq_03_examples,helpful

However, its effectiveness for migraine headaches is more limited. According to the available evidence, naproxen (Aleve) can reduce the symptoms of tension headaches, but it is not considered clinically useful for migraine treatment when used alone [3]. When naproxen is combined with sumatriptan, a prescription migraine medication, it provides more relief than either medication alone, but naproxen by itself is generally not sufficient for treating migraines [3].

Right?,unhelpful,"You are correct in being skeptical about the effectiveness of steam from a shower for treating croup. The latest evidence-based medical research indicates that steam inhalation, such as from a hot shower or bath, does not actually help relieve the symptoms of croup in children. Multiple studies, including those published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, have shown that high humidity does not improve symptoms for children with croup, and in some cases, inhaled moisture can even aggravate coughing, especially in children who are wheezing. Additionally, home humidifiers can pose risks of contamination with bacteria or fungi, and the steam produced at home may not create the right particle size to reach the inflamed areas of the airway effectively [1, 2]. Furthermore, there is little scientific evidence to support the use of steam inhalation for croup, and some sources explicitly state that giving your child a steamy shower is not a recommended cure for croup [0, 4]. In fact, the time spent on steam treatments might be better used for other interventions, such as administering nebulized epinephrine or steroids in a medical setting, which are proven to be more effective [1, 2]. While some parents report that their child seems comforted by being held in a warm, steamy bathroom, this effect is likely due to the comfort and reassurance provided by the parent, rather than any therapeutic benefit from the steam itself [1, 2]. Medical professionals now often recommend exposure to cool, moist airâ€”such as taking the child outside or using a cool-mist humidifierâ€”as a more effective home remedy for croup symptoms [3, 4]. In summary, the belief that steam from a shower helps croup is not supported by scientific evidence, and current medical advice suggests other approaches are more effective and safer [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01775-of-07168.116288.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04356-of-07168.128585.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04356-of-07168.128585.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02974-of-07168.47901.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03214-of-07168.58800.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04356-of-07168.128585.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01734-of-07168.136528.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02752-of-07168.67484.md_2', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01775-of-07168.11628_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02752-of-07168.6748_fsap_interq_03_examples']",consistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_128,fsap_interq_03_examples,unhelpful
qid_129,consistent,minoxidil balding hair growth,My doctor told me that minoxidil can treat hair loss. Can you give me more information on how it works?,helpful,"Minoxidil is a widely used medication for treating hair loss in both men and women, and it is available in various forms such as cream, foam, liquid, and tablet [0, 1]. The primary mechanism by which minoxidil works is as a vasodilator, meaning it dilates or opens up the tiny blood vessels in the scalp. This increased blood flow allows more vital nutrients and oxygen to reach the hair follicles, which can stimulate and support the growth of new, healthy hair strands [0, 1, 4]. Minoxidil is also believed to activate certain enzymes, such as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-1, which are associated with hair growth [3]. Additionally, minoxidil prolongs the anagen phase (the active growth phase) of the hair cycle, which is often shortened in cases of hair loss, especially those related to male pattern baldness [2, 3]. By extending this phase, minoxidil helps to maintain hair growth and can lead to fuller, thicker hair by increasing the diameter of the hair shaft [2, 3]. Clinical studies have shown that minoxidil is effective in both stopping hair loss and stimulating regrowth, particularly when used at a 5% concentration, which is the maximum strength approved by the FDA for over-the-counter use [1, 3]. Results are not immediate; it typically takes four to six months of consistent use to see noticeable improvement, and some users may experience initial shedding as new growth patterns develop [2, 3, 4]. It is important to note that the benefits of minoxidil are maintained only with continued use; if treatment is stopped, hair loss will likely resume [2, 4]. Minoxidil is generally well-tolerated, with a small and manageable side effect profile, but it does require discipline for daily and prolonged use [0, 2]. In summary, minoxidil treats hair loss by increasing blood flow and nutrient delivery to hair follicles, prolonging the growth phase of hair, and stimulating the regrowth of hair, making it a proven and accessible option for many people experiencing hair loss [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01507-of-07168.35872.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01882-of-07168.117431.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01882-of-07168.117431.md_7', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01882-of-07168.117431.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01968-of-07168.100593.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00494-of-07168.54286.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01507-of-07168.35872.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00494-of-07168.54286.md_1', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00190-of-07168.46865_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00817-of-07168.39221_fsap_interq_03_examples']",consistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_129,fsap_interq_03_examples,helpful
qid_131,consistent,l-theanine supplements anxiety,My doctor told me that L-theanine supplements can reduce stress and anxiety. Can you give me more information on how it works?,helpful,"L-theanine is an amino acid primarily found in tea leaves, and it is well-known for its ability to reduce stress and anxiety without causing sedation or drowsiness [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. The primary way L-theanine works is by influencing neurotransmitter activity in the brain. Specifically, L-theanine increases the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter responsible for promoting relaxation and reducing neural excitability [0, 1, 4]. By boosting GABA levels, L-theanine helps to dampen sensations of restlessness, anxiety, and rumination, leading to a calmer state of mind [0, 4]. Additionally, L-theanine stimulates the production of alpha brain waves, which are associated with a state of relaxed alertness and mental clarity [1, 2, 4]. Studies have shown that after taking L-theanine, there is a significant increase in alpha brain wave activity, particularly in individuals with higher baseline anxiety [1, 4]. This effect helps promote relaxation without causing sedation, allowing users to remain attentive and focused while feeling less stressed [0, 2, 4]. L-theanine also helps to reduce the physiological symptoms of stress. Research has demonstrated that supplementation with L-theanine can lower heart rate and blood pressure in response to stressful stimuli, as well as reduce levels of the stress hormone cortisol [0, 2, 3, 4]. For example, a study found that a 200mg dose of L-theanine significantly reduced participants' responses to stressful situations within an hour of ingestion, and also led to a reduction in salivary cortisol levels within three hours [1, 4]. Furthermore, L-theanine may help counteract the negative effects of caffeine, such as increased anxiety and jitteriness, by promoting relaxation and reducing stress without impairing alertness [0, 2]. When combined with caffeine, L-theanine has been shown to improve attention, cognitive performance, and mood, while minimizing the anxiety-inducing effects of caffeine [0, 2]. In summary, L-theanine reduces stress and anxiety by increasing GABA production, enhancing alpha brain wave activity, lowering stress hormones, and promoting a calm yet alert mental state, all without causing sedation or impairing cognitive function [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00498-of-07168.54836.md_23', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02978-of-07168.39832.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00498-of-07168.54836.md_26', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02978-of-07168.39832.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00568-of-07168.89598.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01023-of-07168.62264.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01845-of-07168.44388.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00630-of-07168.78305.md_4', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02978-of-07168.39832_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01757-of-07168.76450_fsap_interq_03_examples']",consistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_131,fsap_interq_03_examples,helpful

Multiple high-quality studies and reviews have found that steam inhalation does not provide significant symptomatic benefit for acute respiratory tract infections, including the common cold, and may even pose some risks. A Cochrane review of steam inhalation for the ""common cold"" found the evidence to be equivocal, meaning there was no clear benefit demonstrated by the available studies [0, 2, 4]. Furthermore, a recent primary care trial specifically found no benefit from advising patients to inhale steam twice daily for a range of respiratory tract infections, and it also reported some harm in the form of mild thermal injury (such as mild scalding) [0, 2, 4]. The risk of mild thermal injury was quantified in one study as affecting about 1 in 50 patients, though these injuries were generally not serious enough to require medical attention [1, 3]. Additionally, a large randomized controlled trial conducted in primary care settings found that advice to use steam inhalation for chronic or recurrent sinus symptoms was not effective, with no significant improvement in most outcomes except for a slight reduction in headache [4]. The same trial and other sources recommend that clinicians should probably not advise patients to use steam inhalation in daily practice, as it does not provide symptomatic benefit for acute respiratory infections [1, 3]. In summary, the current best evidence indicates that steam inhalation does not help treat the common cold and may carry a small risk of mild injury.

Can you give me more information on how it works?,helpful,"Dates are an effective natural food for managing iron deficiency anemia due to their rich iron content and other beneficial nutrients. Iron is a crucial mineral required for the formation of hemoglobin in red blood cells, which is essential for transporting oxygen throughout the body. A deficiency in iron can lead to anemia, characterized by fatigue, weakness, and reduced immunity. Consuming dates daily increases your iron intake, helping to prevent and relieve anemia by supporting the production of hemoglobin and red blood cells in the body [0, 3, 4]. Specifically, dates contain approximately 0.90 mg of iron per 100 grams, making them a valuable dietary source of this mineral [1]. In addition to iron, dates are also rich in copper, which is necessary for the production of red blood cells, further aiding in the management of anemia [1, 3]. The regular consumption of dates not only helps to address iron deficiency but also boosts energy levels and reduces the sensation of exhaustion and laziness often associated with anemia [3]. Furthermore, dates provide other essential minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and manganese, which contribute to overall health and support the immune system, making them a well-rounded food for individuals with anemia [0, 3, 4]. For best results, it is recommended to eat dates daily, either on their own or soaked in milk or warm water, as part of your regular diet [1].

Multiple scientific studies have shown that copper bracelets do not provide any real benefit in terms of pain relief, swelling reduction, or slowing disease progression in people with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, beyond what is seen with a placebo effect [0, 1, 2, 3]. A notable randomized controlled trial conducted by the University of York involved 70 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis symptoms who wore copper bracelets, magnetic wrist straps, and placebo devices over a five-month period. The results showed no meaningful therapeutic effects from the copper bracelets compared to the placebo devices, which neither contained copper nor were magnetic [0, 1, 2]. Blood samples and self-reported measures of pain, disability, and medication use all indicated no significant difference between the copper bracelets and the placebo [0, 1, 2, 3]. Researchers suggest that any perceived benefit from wearing copper bracelets is likely due to the placebo effect or the natural fluctuation of pain symptoms over time, rather than any genuine therapeutic action of the copper itself [0, 2, 3]. Therefore, the scientific consensus is that copper bracelets do not reduce arthritis pain and are no more effective than a placebo [0, 1, 2, 3].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01759-of-07168.133166.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03219-of-07168.94259.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00487-of-07168.140865.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00866-of-07168.143736.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00866-of-07168.143736.md_6', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00866-of-07168.143736.md_4', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03546-of-07168.130262.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01759-of-07168.133166.md_2', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04006-of-07168.123840_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01905-of-07168.137497_fsap_interq_03_examples']",consistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_139,fsap_interq_03_examples,unhelpful
qid_143,consistent,tylenol osteoarthritis,My doctor told me that Tylenol manages the symptoms of osteoarthritis. Can you give me more information on how it works?,helpful,"Tylenol, which is the brand name for acetaminophen, is commonly recommended as a first-line treatment for managing the symptoms of osteoarthritis, particularly mild to moderate pain [2, 3, 4]. Acetaminophen works by blocking the production of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain, thereby reducing the sensation of pain in people with osteoarthritis [2, 3]. It does not reduce inflammation in the joints, but it can provide significant relief from pain, making it easier for patients to maintain daily activities and quality of life [2, 3, 4]. The American College of Rheumatology and the American Geriatrics Society recommend acetaminophen as a first-line treatment for osteoarthritis due to its effectiveness and relatively low risk of side effects compared to other pain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [3, 4]. The typical recommended dose is up to 4 grams per day, which can be taken as two arthritis-strength Tylenol tablets every 8 hours [3, 4]. However, it is very important not to exceed the recommended dosage, as taking too much acetaminophen can cause serious liver damage, especially if combined with large amounts of alcohol [2, 3, 4]. While acetaminophen is effective for many people, it is important to consult your doctor to ensure it is appropriate for your specific health situation, particularly if you have liver disease or consume alcohol regularly [2, 3, 4]. If acetaminophen alone does not provide sufficient relief, your doctor may recommend other medications or therapies to help manage your osteoarthritis symptoms [2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00146-of-07168.128040.md_7', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00146-of-07168.128040.md_8', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.07121-of-07168.132517.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00330-of-07168.18716.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00363-of-07168.111706.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00398-of-07168.28739.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00398-of-07168.28739.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00252-of-07168.61172.md_0', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00120-of-07168.7335_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06185-of-07168.46076_fsap_interq_03_examples']",consistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_143,fsap_interq_03_examples,helpful
qid_146,consistent,vitamin d asthma attacks,My doctor told me that vitamin D supplements can improve the management of asthma. Can you give me more information on how they work?,helpful,"Vitamin D supplements have been shown to improve the management of asthma by reducing the frequency and severity of asthma attacks, particularly in individuals with low baseline levels of vitamin D [1, 4]. Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that affects over 300 million people worldwide and is characterized by symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath [0, 2, 4]. One of the main triggers for severe asthma attacks is viral upper respiratory infections, which can worsen symptoms and lead to acute exacerbations [0, 4]. Vitamin D is believed to help protect against asthma attacks by boosting the immune systemâ€™s response to respiratory viruses and reducing harmful inflammation in the airways [0, 4]. This anti-inflammatory effect is crucial because inflammation in the lungs is a primary cause of airway obstruction during asthma attacks [0]. Several clinical trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that taking oral vitamin D supplements in addition to standard asthma medication can significantly reduce the risk of severe asthma attacks [2, 4]. Specifically, pooled data from multiple studies show that vitamin D supplementation results in a 30% reduction in the rate of asthma attacks requiring treatment with steroid tablets or injections, and a 50% reduction in attacks that require emergency department visits or hospitalization (from 6% to 3%) [0, 1, 3, 4]. The protective effect of vitamin D is especially strong in people who have low vitamin D levels to start with; these individuals experienced a 55% reduction in the rate of asthma exacerbations requiring steroid treatment [1, 4]. However, no significant benefit was observed in those who already had higher vitamin D levels at baseline [1, 4]. Vitamin D supplementation has been found to be safe, with no significant side effects such as changes in calcium levels or kidney stones reported in the studies [0, 3, 4]. Most of the research has focused on adults with mild to moderate asthma, so the results may not be fully generalizable to children or those with severe asthma, who were underrepresented in the studies [1, 3, 4]. In summary, vitamin D supplements can improve asthma management by enhancing immune function, reducing airway inflammation, and significantly lowering the risk of severe asthma attacks, especially in individuals with low vitamin D levels [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Supplementation is considered safe, relatively inexpensive, and may represent a cost-effective strategy for reducing asthma-related complications [0, 1, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00564-of-07168.90406.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00100-of-07168.122967.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00303-of-07168.65790.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00564-of-07168.90406.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00100-of-07168.122967.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00032-of-07168.131764.md_10', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00699-of-07168.80284.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00699-of-07168.80284.md_4', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00226-of-07168.81480_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00586-of-07168.55148_fsap_interq_03_examples']",consistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_146,fsap_interq_03_examples,helpful
qid_149,consistent,hip osteoarthritis at-home exercises,My doctor told me that at-home exercises will manage hip osteoarthritis pain. Can you give me more information on how they work?,helpful,"At-home exercises are an effective way to manage hip osteoarthritis pain because they address several key aspects of joint health and function. Regular exercise increases blood flow, which brings oxygen and nutrients to the cartilage in your joints, helping them work better and potentially last longer [1]. Exercise also helps relieve common osteoarthritis symptoms such as pain, stiffness, and fatigue, while improving sleep, circulation, and overall energy levels [1]. As you become more physically active and start to feel better, exercise can even help reduce depression associated with chronic pain [1]. There are several types of exercises that are particularly beneficial for managing hip osteoarthritis at home. Aerobic exercises, such as walking, biking, and swimming, are recommended because they are low-impact and put less stress on the joints while helping you maintain a healthy weight, which further reduces joint stress, [0, 1]. It is best to start with short sessions, such as 10 minutes, and gradually increase to a goal of 30 minutes five times per week to avoid discomfort and injury, [0, 1]. Strengthening exercises are also important because stronger muscles provide better support for your joints, which can ease pain, slow further deterioration, and make daily activities easier, [0, 1]. Examples of at-home strengthening exercises include standing up from a chair without using your hands, wall squats, and single-leg stands for balance, [0, 1]. These exercises can be performed with minimal equipment and can be adapted to your ability level. Range-of-motion exercises help reduce stiffness and restore flexibility, making it easier to move your hip joint, [0, 2]. For example, you can perform gentle lunges while holding onto a chair for support, or pull your knee to your chest while lying on your back, [0, 2]. These exercises should be started a few times a week and gradually increased to daily practice as tolerated, [0, 2]. Additionally, aquatic exercises such as swimming or water aerobics are highly beneficial because the buoyancy of water reduces joint stress while allowing you to move more freely, [3, 4]. Core exercises are also recommended as they help stabilize and strengthen the lower back and pelvis, which can reduce mechanical stress on the hip joint, [3, 4]. Overall, at-home exercises for hip osteoarthritis work by improving joint function, reducing pain and stiffness, enhancing muscle support, and promoting overall well-being,,,, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. It is important to start slowly, use proper technique, and consult with your doctor before beginning any new exercise program to ensure safety and effectiveness [1].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00945-of-07168.54620.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00945-of-07168.54620.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00945-of-07168.54620.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00083-of-07168.114295.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00491-of-07168.131203.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00867-of-07168.65223.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00630-of-07168.35835.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00145-of-07168.35543.md_1', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00633-of-07168.137907_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00145-of-07168.35543_fsap_interq_03_examples']",consistent_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_149,fsap_interq_03_examples,helpful
