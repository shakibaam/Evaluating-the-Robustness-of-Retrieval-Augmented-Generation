qid_103,neutral,folic acid dementia,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,unhelpful,"There is currently no conclusive evidence that folic acid supplementation can improve cognitive function or treat dementia in the general population or in people with Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia [3]. While low blood folate levels are associated with poor cognitive performance, supplementation with folic acid appears to be beneficial only for individuals with low folate levels, and not for those with normal levels [3]. Reviews of randomized, controlled trials have shown mixed results, with no clear benefit of folic acid supplements on cognitive function in healthy adults or those with mild to moderate cognitive decline or dementia [3]. Meta-analyses of studies involving aged participants have found no evidence that supplementation with folic acid, alone or in combination with vitamins B12 and B6, improves or attenuates declines in cognitive function, regardless of participantsâ€™ baseline cognitive status, study duration, or background folate status [1]. Even in studies where homocysteine levels were significantly reduced by supplementation, no benefits were observed in global cognitive function or specific cognitive domains [1]. However, some evidence suggests that supplementation with B vitamins may attenuate the rate of cerebral atrophy in individuals with higher homocysteine levels at the outset, but this does not directly translate to improved cognitive function or treatment of dementia [1]. A small preliminary study specifically evaluating folic acid supplementation in patients with dementia and low-normal folic acid levels found no statistically significant difference in cognitive change between the folic acid and placebo groups, though there was a trend toward worsening of some cognitive abilities in the folic acid group [2]. The authors concluded that larger studies are necessary before recommending folic acid supplementation for patients already suffering from dementia [2]. In summary, the current body of evidence does not support the use of folic acid supplementation as a means to improve cognition or treat dementia in unselected populations, though it may be considered in individuals with documented folate deficiency,, [1, 2, 3]. Further research is needed to clarify whether specific subgroups, such as those with high homocysteine or low folate levels, might benefit from supplementation, [1, 3].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03610-of-07168.48770.md_10', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05964-of-07168.39091.md_40', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00585-of-07168.24341.md_10', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06165-of-07168.10154.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03525-of-07168.126160.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06467-of-07168.125883.md_13', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06755-of-07168.140339.md_4', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06165-of-07168.10154.md_2', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03525-of-07168.126160_fsap_intraq', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05825-of-07168.47791_fsap_intraq']",neutral_helpful_biased_fsap_intraq_103,fsap_intraq,unhelpful

Instead, the recommended first aid for a burn is to cool the burned area by running it under cool (not icy cold) running water for 10 to 20 minutes or until the pain subsides, or by using cool compresses [0, 1, 2, 3]. Using ice or ice water is specifically discouraged because it can lower the body temperature too much and may lead to additional complications such as hypothermia, especially if the burn is large [1, 3, 4].

qid_107,neutral,yoga asthma,Does yoga improve the management of asthma?,helpful,"There is substantial evidence that yoga can improve the management of asthma. Multiple randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews have demonstrated that yoga interventions, when added to conventional asthma care, result in significant improvements in both subjective and objective outcomes for patients with asthma. These improvements include better pulmonary function, such as increased forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), as well as enhanced asthma-related quality of life and reduced frequency of asthma attacks and medication use [1, 2, 4]. For example, a large prospective study following 570 bronchial asthma patients for up to 54 months found highly significant improvements in specific parameters, including PEFR, and reported that a substantial proportion of patients were able to reduce or stop their asthma medications after practicing yoga regularly [1]. Another randomized controlled trial showed that patients who practiced yoga experienced a steady and progressive improvement in pulmonary function and a significant reduction in exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, with earlier and more complete improvements in asthma quality of life scores compared to those receiving only conventional care [2, 4]. Additionally, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials with 824 patients found evidence that yoga improved asthma control, symptoms, quality of life, and peak expiratory flow rate compared to usual care [1]. Other studies have also reported that yoga, when used as an adjunctive therapy, can lead to improvements in mood, perceived stress, and overall well-being in asthma patients, although the physiological mechanisms underlying these benefits are not yet fully understood [0, 3]. Some studies have noted that while yoga improves subjective and objective outcomes, it does not always result in measurable changes in certain immunological markers, suggesting that the benefits may be mediated through physical and psychological pathways rather than direct immunological effects [2, 4]. In summary, the available evidence supports the efficacy of yoga as a complementary intervention in the management of asthma, leading to improvements in lung function, quality of life, and reduction in medication use, although further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms involved [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_6', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_12', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_4', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00070-of-07168.14002.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05358-of-07168.95802.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05358-of-07168.95802.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05358-of-07168.95802.md_27', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05343-of-07168.94673_fsap_intraq', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05343-of-07168.94673_fsap_intraq']",neutral_helpful_biased_fsap_intraq_107,fsap_intraq,helpful

The old adage ""feed a cold, starve a fever"" is not supported by modern medical advice, as hydration and proper nutrition are important for recovery from both colds and fevers, especially in children. Starving yourself during a fever can lead to dehydration, which is particularly risky for sick children and can worsen their condition [0]. Medical experts recommend maintaining fluid intake and eating light, nourishing foods to help the body fight off infection, regardless of whether the illness is accompanied by a fever or a cold, [1, 3]. There is little scientific reason to increase or decrease how much you eat based on having a fever, and poor nutrition will not help you recover faster [4]. While some small studies have suggested that feeding or fasting may influence different immune responses, these findings are not sufficient to base treatment decisions on, and the general consensus is to avoid starving a fever, [1, 2].

Large, well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have consistently shown no beneficial effect of selenium supplementation on reducing the overall risk of cancer or the risk of specific cancers, including prostate cancer, which has been the most studied outcome in this context [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. In fact, some RCTs have raised concerns that selenium supplementation may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer, type 2 diabetes, and dermatological abnormalities, particularly in individuals with already high selenium status [0, 1, 3, 4]. Observational studies have sometimes suggested an association between higher selenium exposure and lower cancer incidence or mortality, especially for certain cancers such as stomach, colorectal, bladder, and prostate cancers, and these associations appeared more pronounced in men [1, 4]. However, these studies have significant limitations, including potential misclassification of selenium exposure, unmeasured confounding factors related to lifestyle or nutrition, and the lack of a clear dose-response relationship between selenium status and cancer risk [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. The certainty of evidence from these observational studies is considered very low, and their findings are inconsistent [0, 2, 4]. Overall, the current consensus from systematic reviews and meta-analyses is that increasing selenium intake through diet or supplementation does not prevent cancer in humans [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].

In a randomized controlled trial involving 465 pregnant women, daily supplementation with 50 mg zinc sulfate did not result in significant differences in newborn weight, height, or head circumference compared to placebo, nor did it reduce the frequency of low birth weight infants, leading to the conclusion that zinc supplementation had no beneficial effect on fetal growth in this study population [0]. This finding is consistent with the majority of meta-analyses, although some studies have reported different results [0]. Further, a review of the evidence indicates that the relationship between prenatal zinc supplementation and pregnancy-related outcomes, including neonatal morbidity, is weak [2]. In a clinic-based trial, adding zinc to a B-complex vitamin formulation did not produce any benefit in terms of pregnancy or neonatal outcomes [2]. Additionally, studies of multiple micronutrient supplementation, which included zinc, did not show improvements in maternal or newborn serum zinc levels or in newborn birth size compared to supplementation with iron only or placebo, [3, 4]. It is important to note that zinc supplementation during pregnancy should only be given when a clear need has been established, such as in cases of diagnosed zinc deficiency, as per dietary guidelines [1].

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dupixent for use in adults whose eczema is not adequately controlled by topical therapies or for whom topical therapies are not advisable [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Dupixent can be used with or without topical corticosteroids [0, 1, 2, 3]. Dupixent is a human monoclonal antibody that works by inhibiting the overactive signaling of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13), which are believed to be major drivers of the persistent underlying inflammation in atopic dermatitis [1, 4]. It is administered as a subcutaneous injection, typically every two weeks after an initial loading dose, and can be self-administered using a pre-filled syringe after proper training [1, 2]. The safety and efficacy of Dupixent were established in several placebo-controlled clinical trials, including the global LIBERTY AD clinical trial program, which involved thousands of adult participants with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis not adequately controlled by topical medications [0, 1, 3, 4]. In these studies, participants who received Dupixent achieved a greater response, defined as clear or almost clear skin, and experienced a reduction in itch after 16 weeks of treatment [0, 1, 4].

Sumatriptan is a member of the triptan family of drugs and is specifically indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults, as supported by multiple clinical guidelines and evidence assessments [0, 3, 4]. It is available in several formulations, including oral tablets, subcutaneous injections, and intranasal sprays, all of which have demonstrated efficacy in relieving migraine headache pain and associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia (sensitivity to light), and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound) [0, 3, 4]. Clinical studies and systematic reviews have shown that both the 10 mg and 20 mg intranasal doses of sumatriptan are effective in reducing migraine pain from moderate or severe to mild or absent within two hours of administration, with the 20 mg dose generally providing greater efficacy [3, 4]. Additionally, sumatriptan is associated with relief of other migraine-related symptoms and a reduction in the need for rescue medication compared to placebo [3, 4]. The American Headache Society and other expert reviews recognize sumatriptan as an effective abortive therapy for acute migraine, and it is widely used in clinical practice for this purpose [0, 3, 4]. However, it is important to note that while sumatriptan is effective, it may be associated with mild to moderate adverse events, which are generally transient [3, 4]. In summary, Imitrex (sumatriptan) is an effective and well-established treatment for acute migraine attacks, providing relief from headache pain and associated symptoms in a significant proportion of patients [0, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06984-of-07168.4146.md_18', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01725-of-07168.85567.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01904-of-07168.88030.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00201-of-07168.60025.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00201-of-07168.60025.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01725-of-07168.85567.md_11', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06984-of-07168.4146.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01904-of-07168.88030.md_17', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01725-of-07168.85567_fsap_intraq', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03853-of-07168.9476_fsap_intraq']",neutral_helpful_biased_fsap_intraq_120,fsap_intraq,helpful

However, when it comes to migraine headaches specifically, naproxen (Aleve) is not considered clinically useful for migraine treatment when used alone [3]. Studies and clinical guidelines indicate that while naproxen can reduce the symptoms of tension headaches, its effectiveness for migraines is limited unless it is combined with other medications, such as sumatriptan [3]. When naproxen is used in combination with sumatriptan, it provides more relief than either medication alone and may help prevent refractory migraines [3]. Therefore, while Aleve may provide some relief for headache pain, it is generally not recommended as a standalone treatment for migraine headaches [3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06218-of-07168.119727.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02859-of-07168.22259.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06036-of-07168.11059.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03757-of-07168.82913.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03757-of-07168.82913.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01776-of-07168.24472.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01005-of-07168.135381.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01005-of-07168.135381.md_1', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03757-of-07168.8291_fsap_intraq', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06036-of-07168.1105_fsap_intraq']",neutral_helpful_biased_fsap_intraq_122,fsap_intraq,unhelpful

For example, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that high humidity did not improve symptoms for children with croup, and researchers warned that inhaled moisture can sometimes aggravate coughing in children who are wheezing [1, 2]. Additionally, popular home remedies such as steamy baths or showers are not supported by evidence-based medicine, and some experts caution that steam treatment should only be used under careful supervision due to the risk of scalding [0, 1, 2]. Instead, some pediatricians recommend exposure to cool, moist air, such as taking the child outside or using a cool-mist humidifier, as this may help reduce airway swelling more effectively than steam [3, 4].

qid_129,neutral,minoxidil balding hair growth,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,helpful,"Yes, minoxidil can treat hair loss and is one of the most widely used and scientifically supported treatments for this condition. Minoxidil is a vasodilator that increases blood flow to the scalp, which is believed to help deliver more nutrients and oxygen to hair follicles, thereby promoting hair growth and revitalizing hair follicles that may have become dormant or weakened due to hair loss conditions such as male and female pattern baldness [0, 1, 4]. Clinical studies and research have shown that minoxidil is effective in both stopping hair loss and stimulating the regrowth of hair, making it one of the few non-prescription products approved by the FDA for this purpose [1, 2]. It is available in various forms, including liquid, foam, cream, and aerosol, and can be used by both men and women [0, 1, 3]. The most effective concentration for hair regrowth, as demonstrated in studies, is 5% minoxidil, which has been shown to result in significantly greater hair regrowth compared to lower concentrations [1, 3]. Minoxidil works by prolonging the anagen (growth) phase of the hair cycle, which is often shortened in individuals experiencing hair loss, particularly due to androgenetic alopecia (pattern hair loss) [2, 3]. While the exact mechanism is not fully understood, its efficacy in promoting hair regrowth and preventing further loss is well documented [3]. However, it is important to note that minoxidil is not a cure for hair loss. Its effects are maintained only with continued use; if treatment is stopped, hair loss typically resumes [2, 4]. Additionally, while minoxidil can slow hair loss and promote regrowth, it may not fully restore hair in areas of significant thinning or receding hairlines, and results can vary between individuals [4]. Visible improvements generally take four to six months of consistent use, and some users may experience initial shedding as new hair growth cycles begin [2, 3, 4]. In summary, minoxidil is an effective, FDA-approved treatment for hair loss that can help stop further loss and stimulate regrowth, especially when used consistently and as part of a comprehensive hair care regimen [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01507-of-07168.35872.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01882-of-07168.117431.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01882-of-07168.117431.md_7', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01882-of-07168.117431.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01968-of-07168.100593.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00494-of-07168.54286.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01507-of-07168.35872.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00494-of-07168.54286.md_1', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01882-of-07168.117431_fsap_intraq', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00494-of-07168.54286_fsap_intraq']",neutral_helpful_biased_fsap_intraq_129,fsap_intraq,helpful
qid_131,neutral,l-theanine supplements anxiety,Can l-theanine supplements reduce stress and anxiety?,helpful,"Yes, L-theanine supplements can reduce stress and anxiety, according to multiple scientific studies and reviews. L-theanine is an amino acid found primarily in tea leaves, and it is well-documented for its ability to promote relaxation and calmness without causing sedation or drowsiness [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. L-theanine works by increasing the production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in the brain, which helps to dampen sensations of restlessness, anxiety, and rumination, thereby supporting feelings of relaxation and contentment [0, 1, 4]. Research has shown that L-theanine supplementation leads to significant increases in alpha brain wave activity, which is associated with a relaxed but alert mental state [1, 2, 4]. This effect is particularly pronounced in individuals with high baseline anxiety [1, 2]. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that a single dose of 200 mg of L-theanine can significantly reduce the physiological and psychological response to stressful stimuli, such as lowering heart rate and blood pressure, within about one hour of ingestion [0, 1, 3, 4]. For example, a 2016 study found that L-theanine supplementation reduced stress responses in healthy volunteers, and another study showed that it decreased salivary alpha-amylase activity, a marker of stress, in pharmacy students [1, 3, 4]. Additionally, L-theanine has been shown to reduce both the mental and physical symptoms of stress, including lowering cortisol levels, which is the bodyâ€™s primary stress hormone [2, 4]. It can also help prevent the abrupt rise in blood pressure that some people experience under stress, further supporting its role in stress reduction [0, 3, 4]. Importantly, L-theanine achieves these calming effects without causing sedation or impairing cognitive or motor function, making it suitable for use during the day [0, 1, 2, 4]. In fact, it may even improve alertness, attention, and cognitive performance, especially when combined with caffeine [0, 2, 4]. In summary, there is substantial evidence that L-theanine supplements can effectively reduce stress and anxiety by promoting relaxation, increasing alpha brain wave activity, and modulating neurotransmitter levels, all without causing drowsiness or impairing daily functioning [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00498-of-07168.54836.md_23', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02978-of-07168.39832.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00498-of-07168.54836.md_26', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02978-of-07168.39832.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00568-of-07168.89598.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01023-of-07168.62264.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01845-of-07168.44388.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00630-of-07168.78305.md_4', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00498-of-07168.54836_fsap_intraq', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00630-of-07168.78305_fsap_intraq']",neutral_helpful_biased_fsap_intraq_131,fsap_intraq,helpful

In a large randomized controlled trial, steam inhalation was shown to reduce headache but had no significant effect on other outcomes related to chronic or recurrent sinus symptoms, and the overall interpretation was that advice to use steam inhalation for these symptoms in primary care was not effective [4]. Furthermore, another study found that patients with acute respiratory tract infections, such as colds and sore throats, derived no benefit from steam inhalation, and about 1 in 50 patients experienced mild scalding, though not serious enough to require medical attention [1, 3].

Additionally, methods like burning the tick or using chemicals can also cause the tick to burst or release infectious fluids, further increasing the risk of infection [2, 3, 4]. The correct way to remove a tick is to use fine-tipped tweezers or forceps. You should grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible and pull it out steadily and straight, without twisting or squeezing the body, to avoid leaving the mouthparts in the skin or causing the tick to regurgitate [2, 3, 4]. After removal, clean the bite area and your hands with soap and water or an antiseptic [3, 4].

Specifically, dates contain about 0.90 mg of iron per 100 grams, making them a beneficial food for those suffering from anemia [1]. The iron content in dates helps to boost hemoglobin levels and supports the production of red blood cells, thereby alleviating symptoms such as fatigue and weakness commonly associated with anemia [1, 3, 4]. Additionally, dates are also rich in other minerals like copper, which is necessary for red blood cell production, further supporting their role in managing anemia [1, 3].

Experimental evidence shows that to actually soften a fish bone with vinegar, the bone would need to be soaked in vinegar for several hours, which is not achievable by simply drinking vinegar [1, 2, 4]. Furthermore, drinking vinegar can irritate the throat lining, cause acute congestion, aggravate inflammation, and, if consumed in large amounts, may lead to stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, or even acute gastritis [2]. There are also documented cases where drinking undiluted vinegar as a folk remedy for fish bones has caused caustic burns to the esophagus, highlighting the potential dangers of this practice [3].

The protective effect of vitamin D was particularly strong and statistically significant in participants who had low vitamin D levels at the start of the studies, with a 55% reduction in the rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with steroid tablets or injections (from 0.42 events per person per year to 0.19) [1, 4]. However, no statistically significant benefit was observed among those who had higher vitamin D levels at baseline [1, 4]. Vitamin D is thought to help by boosting immune responses to respiratory viruses, which are common triggers for asthma attacks, and by reducing harmful inflammation in the airways [0, 4]. The supplementation was found to be safe, with no significant side effects such as changes in calcium levels or kidney stones reported in the studies [0, 3]. It is important to note that most of the evidence comes from studies involving adults with mild to moderate asthma, and people with severe asthma were underrepresented, so the findings may not be fully generalizable to all asthma patients [1, 3, 4]. Nonetheless, vitamin D supplementation is considered a safe, relatively inexpensive, and potentially cost-effective strategy to help reduce the burden of asthma attacks, especially in individuals with low vitamin D levels [0, 1, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00564-of-07168.90406.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00100-of-07168.122967.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00303-of-07168.65790.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00564-of-07168.90406.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00100-of-07168.122967.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00032-of-07168.131764.md_10', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00699-of-07168.80284.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00699-of-07168.80284.md_4', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00128-of-07168.48353_fsap_intraq', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00226-of-07168.81480_fsap_intraq']",neutral_helpful_biased_fsap_intraq_146,fsap_intraq,helpful
qid_149,neutral,hip osteoarthritis at-home exercises,Will at-home exercises manage hip osteoarthritis pain?,helpful,"Yes, at-home exercises can effectively help manage hip osteoarthritis pain. Exercise is considered the most effective non-drug treatment for osteoarthritis, as it can relieve symptoms such as pain, stiffness, and fatigue, while also improving sleep, blood circulation, and overall energy levels [1]. Strengthening exercises performed at home, such as standing up from a chair without using your hands, wall squats, and balance exercises, help support the joints by building muscle strength, which eases pain and combats further deterioration, [0, 1]. Range-of-motion exercises, such as gentle hip stretches and knee-to-chest movements, can also be done at home to ease stiffness and restore flexibility, making movement easier, [0, 2]. Low-impact aerobic activities like walking, biking, and swimming are recommended for those with hip osteoarthritis, and these can often be performed at home or in the local environment, [0, 1]. It is important to start slowly, with short sessions (e.g., 10 minutes), and gradually increase the duration to avoid discomfort and injury, aiming for up to 30 minutes five times a week, [0, 1]. Additionally, core exercises are beneficial as they help stabilize and strengthen weight-bearing structures, reducing mechanical stress on the hips and supporting optimal joint function, [3, 4]. Overall, consistent at-home exercise routines not only help manage pain and improve joint function but also contribute to better cardiovascular fitness, posture, and overall well-being, [3, 4]. However, it is always advisable to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new exercise program, especially if you have severe osteoarthritis or other health concerns, [1, 2].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00945-of-07168.54620.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00945-of-07168.54620.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00945-of-07168.54620.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00083-of-07168.114295.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00491-of-07168.131203.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00867-of-07168.65223.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00630-of-07168.35835.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00145-of-07168.35543.md_1', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00945-of-07168.54620_fsap_intraq', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00491-of-07168.131203_fsap_intraq']",neutral_helpful_biased_fsap_intraq_149,fsap_intraq,helpful
