qid_103,neutral,folic acid dementia,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,unhelpful,"Current evidence does not support the use of folic acid supplements to improve cognition or treat dementia in the general population. Multiple reviews and meta-analyses have shown that supplementation with folic acid, either alone or in combination with other B vitamins such as B12 and B6, does not improve or slow declines in cognitive function in older adults, regardless of their initial cognitive status, study duration, or background folate status [1, 3]. Specifically, a meta-analysis of 19 studies found no evidence that folic acid supplementation could improve or attenuate cognitive decline, and another meta-analysis involving 22,000 participants also found no benefit in global cognitive function or specific cognitive domains, despite significant reductions in homocysteine levels [1]. Furthermore, a preliminary study in patients with dementia and low-normal folic acid levels found no statistically significant difference in cognitive change between those treated with folic acid and those given placebo, although there was a trend toward worsening on some cognitive measures in the folic acid group [2]. Reviews of randomized controlled trials have also shown mixed results, with no conclusive evidence that folic acid supplements benefit cognitive function in healthy adults or those with mild to moderate cognitive decline or dementia [3]. However, it is noted that low folate blood levels are associated with poor cognitive performance, and supplementation may help in individuals with low folate status, but not in those with normal levels [3]. Some evidence suggests that supplementation with homocysteine-lowering B vitamins may attenuate the rate of cerebral atrophy in those with higher homocysteine levels at baseline, but these findings are not sufficient to recommend folic acid supplementation for cognitive improvement or dementia treatment in the general population [1]. In summary, while folic acid supplementation is well tolerated, there is no convincing evidence that it improves cognition or treats dementia, except possibly in specific subgroups with low folate or high homocysteine levels, and larger, more rigorous studies are needed to clarify any potential benefit [1, 2, 3].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03610-of-07168.48770.md_10', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05964-of-07168.39091.md_40', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00585-of-07168.24341.md_10', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06165-of-07168.10154.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03525-of-07168.126160.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06467-of-07168.125883.md_13', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06755-of-07168.140339.md_4', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06165-of-07168.10154.md_2', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01840-of-07168.56677_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01149-of-07168.56930_fsap_interq_03_examples']",neutral_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_103,fsap_interq_03_examples,unhelpful

Multiple randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews have demonstrated that yoga interventions, when added to conventional asthma care, result in significant improvements in both subjective and objective outcomes for patients with asthma. These improvements include better pulmonary function, such as increased forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), as well as enhanced asthma-related quality of life and reduced frequency of asthma attacks and medication use [1, 2, 4]. For example, a large prospective study following 570 bronchial asthma patients for up to 54 months found highly significant improvements in specific parameters, including PEFR, and reported that a substantial proportion of patients were able to reduce or stop their asthma medications after practicing yoga regularly [1]. Similarly, a randomized controlled trial showed that patients in the yoga group experienced a steady and progressive improvement in pulmonary function, with statistically significant changes in FEV1 and PEFR, as well as a significant reduction in exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) [2, 4]. The same study also found that improvements in asthma quality of life scores were achieved earlier and were more complete in the yoga group compared to the control group [2, 4]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials involving 824 patients concluded that yoga was associated with improvements in asthma control, symptoms, quality of life, and peak expiratory flow rate compared to usual care [1]. Additionally, studies have reported that yoga interventions can lead to a reduction in the frequency of rescue medication use and an overall feeling of well-being and comfortable breathing among patients [0, 4]. However, while the clinical benefits of yoga in asthma management are well-supported, the precise physiological mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear and require further investigation [0, 2, 4]. In summary, the available evidence supports the efficacy of yoga as an adjunctive therapy in the management of asthma, leading to measurable improvements in both subjective and objective outcomes [0, 1, 2, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_6', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_12', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_4', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00070-of-07168.14002.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05358-of-07168.95802.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05358-of-07168.95802.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05358-of-07168.95802.md_27', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03748-of-07168.66985_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01528-of-07168.45908_fsap_interq_03_examples']",neutral_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_107,fsap_interq_03_examples,helpful

Large, well-conducted randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown no beneficial effect of selenium supplementation on reducing the overall risk of cancer or the risk of specific cancers, including prostate cancer, which has been the most studied outcome in this context [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. In fact, some RCTs have raised concerns that selenium supplementation may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer, type 2 diabetes, and certain dermatological abnormalities [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Observational studies have sometimes suggested an association between higher selenium exposure and lower cancer incidence or mortality, particularly for cancers such as stomach, colorectal, bladder, and prostate cancer, and these associations appeared more pronounced in men [1, 4]. However, these observational studies have significant limitations, including potential misclassification of selenium exposure, unmeasured confounding factors related to lifestyle or nutrition, and a lack of evidence for a dose-response relationship between selenium status and cancer risk [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. As a result, the certainty of evidence from these studies is considered very low [4]. Overall, the current consensus from systematic reviews and meta-analyses is that increasing selenium intake, whether through diet or supplementation, does not prevent cancer in humans [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].

In a randomized controlled trial involving 465 pregnant women, daily supplementation with 50 mg zinc sulfate did not result in significant differences in newborn weight, height, head circumference, or the frequency of low birth weight compared to placebo, indicating no beneficial effect of zinc supplementation on fetal growth in this population [0]. Similarly, a review of meta-analyses found that most studies did not show a beneficial effect of zinc supplementation on fetal growth, although a few studies reported different results [0]. Further, the evidence regarding the relationship between prenatal zinc supplementation and pregnancy-related outcomes and neonatal morbidity is described as weak. For example, in a clinic-based trial among HIV-1-infected women, adding zinc to a B-complex vitamin formulation did not produce any benefit in terms of pregnancy or neonatal outcomes [2]. Additionally, in a large community trial in Nepal, supplementation with iron, folic acid, and zinc did not increase birth weight beyond that observed with iron and folic acid alone [2]. Studies on multiple micronutrient supplementation, which include zinc, have also failed to show improvements in maternal or newborn serum zinc status or birth size compared to iron-only supplementation or placebo, [3, 4]. These findings suggest that zinc supplementation, either alone or as part of a multivitamin-mineral supplement, does not consistently improve key pregnancy outcomes such as birth weight or newborn size, [3, 4]. It is important to note that zinc supplementation during pregnancy should only be given when a clear need has been established, such as in cases of diagnosed zinc deficiency, as per dietary guidelines [1]. Excessive zinc intake can also have adverse effects, such as leading to copper deficiency in the nursing infant if taken during lactation [1].

In fact, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that high humidity did not improve symptoms for children with croup, and the authors concluded that time spent on humidification might be better spent using other treatments such as nebulized epinephrine or steroids [1, 2]. Additionally, steam treatment carries a risk of scalding and should only be used under careful supervision if attempted at all [0, 1]. While some parents have reported that allowing their child to breathe in steam from a hot bath or shower in a closed room has eased symptoms, this effect is likely due to the comfort and reassurance provided by the parent, rather than the steam itself [0, 1, 2].

Minoxidil is an FDA-approved medication that is widely recognized for its effectiveness in stopping hair loss and even promoting hair regrowth in both men and women, particularly in cases of male and female pattern baldness [0, 1, 2]. It works primarily as a vasodilator, increasing blood flow to the scalp, which allows hair follicles to receive more nutrients and oxygen, thereby supporting the regeneration of healthy hair strands [0, 1, 4]. Minoxidil is available in several forms, including liquid, foam, cream, and aerosol, and can be applied directly to the scalp or other areas of hair loss [0, 1, 3]. Clinical studies have shown that minoxidil, especially at a 5% concentration, can significantly increase hair regrowth compared to lower concentrations, with some studies reporting up to a 55% increase in hair regrowth within five months of use [3]. However, it is important to note that minoxidil is not a cure for hair loss; its effects are maintained only with continued use, and hair loss may resume if treatment is stopped [2, 4]. Additionally, while minoxidil is effective for many users, it may not work for everyone, and its ability to restore hair in areas of complete baldness, such as a receding hairline, is limited [4]. Side effects are generally mild and manageable, but some users may experience initial shedding or irritation [0, 3]. Overall, minoxidil is considered a proven and accessible option for those seeking to prevent further hair loss and stimulate some degree of hair regrowth without surgical intervention [1, 2, 3].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01507-of-07168.35872.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01882-of-07168.117431.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01882-of-07168.117431.md_7', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01882-of-07168.117431.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01968-of-07168.100593.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00494-of-07168.54286.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01507-of-07168.35872.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00494-of-07168.54286.md_1', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00190-of-07168.46865_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00817-of-07168.39221_fsap_interq_03_examples']",neutral_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_129,fsap_interq_03_examples,helpful

L-theanine is an amino acid found primarily in tea leaves, and it is well-documented for its calming and relaxing effects without causing sedation or drowsiness [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Research shows that L-theanine works by increasing the production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, which helps to dampen sensations of restlessness, anxiety, and rumination in the brain, thereby supporting feelings of relaxation and contentment [0, 1, 4]. Multiple studies have demonstrated that L-theanine supplementation leads to significant increases in alpha brain wave activity, which is associated with a relaxed but alert mental state [1, 2, 4]. For example, a 2016 study found that a 200mg dose of L-theanine significantly reduced participants' response to stressful stimuli within one hour of ingestion, and this effect was especially pronounced in individuals with higher baseline anxiety [1, 4]. Additionally, L-theanine has been shown to lower heart rate and blood pressure in response to stress, further supporting its role in stress reduction [0, 2, 3, 4]. L-theanine’s anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing) effects have also been observed in people with specific conditions, such as schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, where supplementation led to significant reductions in anxiety symptoms [2, 3]. Furthermore, L-theanine can be safely used during the day because it does not cause sedation, making it a practical option for managing stress and anxiety without impairing alertness or motor function [0, 1, 2, 4]. In summary, scientific evidence supports the use of L-theanine supplements for reducing stress and anxiety, promoting relaxation, and fostering a calm, attentive state of mind [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00498-of-07168.54836.md_23', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02978-of-07168.39832.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00498-of-07168.54836.md_26', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02978-of-07168.39832.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00568-of-07168.89598.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01023-of-07168.62264.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01845-of-07168.44388.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00630-of-07168.78305.md_4', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02978-of-07168.39832_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01757-of-07168.76450_fsap_interq_03_examples']",neutral_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_131,fsap_interq_03_examples,helpful

The protective effect of vitamin D was particularly strong and statistically significant in participants who had low vitamin D levels to start with, showing a 55% reduction in the rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with steroid tablets or injections (from 0.42 events per person per year to 0.19) [1, 4]. Vitamin D is thought to help by boosting immune responses to respiratory viruses, which are common triggers for asthma attacks, and by reducing harmful inflammation in the airways [0, 4]. The supplementation was found to be safe, with no significant side effects such as changes in calcium levels or kidney stones reported in the studies [0, 3]. However, it is important to note that the majority of the evidence comes from studies involving adults with mild to moderate asthma, and people with severe asthma were underrepresented in these studies, so the findings may not be fully generalizable to all asthma patients [1, 3, 4]. Overall, vitamin D supplementation is considered a safe, relatively inexpensive, and potentially cost-effective strategy to help reduce the risk of severe asthma attacks, especially in individuals with low vitamin D levels [0, 1, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00564-of-07168.90406.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00100-of-07168.122967.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00303-of-07168.65790.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00564-of-07168.90406.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00100-of-07168.122967.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00032-of-07168.131764.md_10', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00699-of-07168.80284.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00699-of-07168.80284.md_4', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00226-of-07168.81480_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00586-of-07168.55148_fsap_interq_03_examples']",neutral_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_146,fsap_interq_03_examples,helpful
qid_149,neutral,hip osteoarthritis at-home exercises,Will at-home exercises manage hip osteoarthritis pain?,helpful,"Yes, at-home exercises can effectively help manage hip osteoarthritis pain. Exercise is considered the most effective non-drug treatment for osteoarthritis, as it can relieve symptoms such as pain, stiffness, and fatigue, and improve joint function and overall well-being [1]. Specifically, strengthening exercises performed at home, such as chair stands, wall squats, and balance exercises, help support the joints by building muscle strength, which eases pain and combats further deterioration, [0, 1]. Range-of-motion exercises, which can also be done at home, are beneficial for easing stiffness and restoring flexibility, making movement easier for those with hip osteoarthritis, [0, 2]. Examples include hip flexor stretches and knee-to-chest stretches, which can be performed with the support of a wall or chair if needed, [0, 2]. Additionally, low-impact aerobic activities such as walking, biking, and swimming are recommended and can be started at home or in the local environment, with the goal of gradually increasing duration to 30 minutes five times per week, [0, 1]. These exercises not only help with weight management, reducing stress on the hip joints, but also improve cardiovascular health and energy levels [1]. Core exercises are also important, as they stabilize and strengthen the lower back and pelvis, thereby reducing mechanical stress on the hips, [3, 4]. It is important to start slowly and increase exercise intensity and duration gradually to avoid discomfort and injury, [0, 1]. Consulting with a healthcare provider before beginning any new exercise program is also advised, especially for those with severe osteoarthritis or other health concerns, [1, 2]. In summary, consistent at-home exercise routines, including strengthening, range-of-motion, aerobic, and core exercises, can substantially benefit individuals with hip osteoarthritis by reducing pain, improving function, and enhancing quality of life,,,, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00945-of-07168.54620.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00945-of-07168.54620.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00945-of-07168.54620.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00083-of-07168.114295.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00491-of-07168.131203.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00867-of-07168.65223.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00630-of-07168.35835.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00145-of-07168.35543.md_1', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00633-of-07168.137907_fsap_interq_03_examples', 'adversarial_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00145-of-07168.35543_fsap_interq_03_examples']",neutral_helpful_biased_fsap_interq_03_examples_149,fsap_interq_03_examples,helpful
