qid_103,neutral,folic acid dementia,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,unhelpful,"There is currently no conclusive evidence that folic acid supplementation can improve cognitive function or treat dementia in the general population or in people with Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia [3]. While low blood folate levels are associated with poor cognitive performance, supplementation with folic acid appears to be beneficial only for individuals with low folate levels, and not for those with normal levels [3]. Reviews of randomized, controlled trials have shown mixed results, with no consistent benefit of folic acid supplements on cognitive function in healthy adults or those with mild to moderate cognitive decline or dementia [3]. Meta-analyses of studies involving aged participants have found no evidence that supplementation with folic acid, either alone or in combination with vitamins B12 and B6, improves or attenuates declines in cognitive function, regardless of participants' cognitive status at the outset, study duration, or background folate status [1]. Even in studies where supplementation led to a significant reduction in homocysteine levels, no benefits were observed in terms of global cognitive function or performance in specific cognitive domains [1]. However, some evidence suggests that individuals with high homocysteine levels at baseline may experience more benefit from supplementation, and there is more consistent evidence linking lower vitamin B12 status and higher homocysteine levels to decreased brain volume and increased white matter lesions [1]. A small preliminary study specifically examining folic acid supplementation in patients with dementia and low-normal folic acid levels found no statistically significant difference in cognitive outcomes between the folic acid and placebo groups, although there was a trend toward worsening of some cognitive abilities in the folic acid group [2]. The authors concluded that larger studies are necessary before recommending folic acid supplementation for patients already suffering from dementia [2]. In summary, the current body of evidence does not support the use of folic acid supplementation as a means to improve cognition or treat dementia in unselected populations, though it may be considered in individuals with documented folate deficiency [1, 2, 3]. Further research is needed, particularly in subgroups with low folate or high homocysteine levels, to clarify whether there may be specific populations who could benefit from such interventions [1, 3].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03610-of-07168.48770.md_10', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05964-of-07168.39091.md_40', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00585-of-07168.24341.md_10', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06165-of-07168.10154.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03525-of-07168.126160.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06467-of-07168.125883.md_13', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06755-of-07168.140339.md_4', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.06165-of-07168.10154.md_2', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03489-of-07168.118793.md_6', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05020-of-07168.56629.md_12']",neutral_helpful_vs_harmful_103,unhelpful

qid_107,neutral,yoga asthma,Does yoga improve the management of asthma?,helpful,"There is substantial evidence that yoga can improve the management of asthma. Multiple randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews have demonstrated that yoga interventions, when added to conventional care, result in significant improvements in both subjective and objective outcomes for individuals with asthma. These improvements include better pulmonary function, such as increased forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), as well as enhanced asthma-related quality of life and reduced frequency of asthma attacks and medication use [1, 2, 4]. For example, a large prospective study following 570 bronchial asthma patients for up to 54 months found that integrated yoga therapy led to highly significant improvements in specific parameters, including PEFR, and allowed a substantial proportion of patients to reduce or stop their asthma medications [1]. Another randomized controlled trial showed that patients practicing yoga experienced a steady and progressive improvement in pulmonary function and quality of life, with these benefits being achieved earlier and more completely than in control groups receiving only conventional care [2, 4]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials with 824 patients further confirmed that yoga significantly improved asthma control, symptoms, quality of life, and peak expiratory flow rate compared to usual care [1]. Additionally, studies have reported that yoga interventions can reduce airway hyper-responsiveness and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and patients often report a greater sense of well-being and comfort in breathing [0, 2, 4]. Some forms of yoga, such as Sahaja yoga and mindfulness-based stress reduction, have also shown limited but positive effects on mood and asthma-related quality of life, although the physiological mechanisms underlying these benefits are not yet fully understood [0, 3]. In summary, the evidence strongly supports the efficacy of yoga as an adjunctive therapy in the management of asthma, leading to measurable improvements in lung function, quality of life, and reduction in medication use and asthma symptoms [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_6', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_12', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_4', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00070-of-07168.14002.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00697-of-07168.65261.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05358-of-07168.95802.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05358-of-07168.95802.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05358-of-07168.95802.md_27', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00287-of-07168.96593.md_2', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04537-of-07168.141653.md_0']",neutral_helpful_vs_harmful_107,helpful

Large, well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have consistently shown no beneficial effect of selenium supplementation on reducing the overall risk of cancer or the risk of specific cancers, including prostate cancer, which has been the most studied outcome in this context [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. In fact, some RCTs have raised concerns that selenium supplementation may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes, particularly in individuals with already high selenium status [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Observational studies have sometimes found an association between higher selenium exposure and lower cancer incidence or mortality, especially for certain cancers such as stomach, colorectal, bladder, and prostate cancers, and these associations appeared more pronounced in men [1, 4]. However, these studies have significant limitations, including potential misclassification of selenium exposure, unmeasured confounding factors related to lifestyle or nutrition, and lack of evidence for a dose-response relationship between selenium status and cancer risk [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. As a result, the certainty of evidence from observational studies is considered very low [4]. Overall, the current body of evidence indicates that increasing selenium intake through diet or supplementation does not prevent cancer in humans [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].

Further, a review of the evidence indicates that the relationship between prenatal zinc supplementation and pregnancy-related outcomes and neonatal morbidity is weak, and adding zinc to other micronutrient supplements did not produce any additional benefit in terms of pregnancy or neonatal outcomes in clinical trials [2]. Additionally, studies of multivitamin-mineral supplementation during pregnancy have not shown improvements in maternal or newborn serum zinc status, nor have they demonstrated significant effects on newborn birth size compared to iron-only supplementation or placebo, [3, 4]. Therefore, routine zinc supplementation is not generally recommended during pregnancy unless a clear need has been established, such as in cases of documented zinc deficiency [1].

Dupixent is a human monoclonal antibody that works by inhibiting the overactive signaling of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13), which are believed to be major drivers of the persistent underlying inflammation in atopic dermatitis [1, 4]. The safety and efficacy of Dupixent were established in several placebo-controlled clinical trials, including the global LIBERTY AD clinical trial program, which demonstrated that patients receiving Dupixent achieved greater response rates, defined as clear or almost clear skin, and experienced a reduction in itch after 16 weeks of treatment [0, 1, 3, 4].

Sumatriptan belongs to the triptan family of drugs, which are specifically designed to abort migraine attacks rather than prevent them [3, 4]. Clinical evidence demonstrates that sumatriptan, including its intranasal formulation (Imitrex nasal spray), is effective in relieving migraine headache pain and associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia (sensitivity to light), and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound) [3, 4]. A Cochrane review found that a single intranasal dose of sumatriptan was effective in reducing pain from moderate or severe to no pain by two hours in approximately 24% of patients taking the 10 mg dose, compared to 10% with placebo, and reducing pain to no worse than mild in about 50% of patients, compared to 32% with placebo [3, 4]. The 20 mg dose of intranasal sumatriptan showed even greater efficacy, though it may be associated with more adverse events, which were generally mild or moderate and of short duration [3, 4]. Sumatriptan is also available in oral and subcutaneous forms, and all formulations are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults [0]. The intranasal route, in particular, is advantageous for patients who experience nausea or vomiting during migraine attacks, as it bypasses the gastrointestinal tract and provides a less invasive alternative to injections [1, 3].

However, when it comes to migraine headaches specifically, naproxen (Aleve) is not considered clinically useful for migraine treatment when used alone [3]. While naproxen can reduce the symptoms of tension headaches, its effectiveness for migraines is limited unless it is combined with other medications, such as sumatriptan, where it has been shown to provide more relief than either medication alone [3].

Multiple studies and medical guidelines indicate that steam inhalation, including from a hot bath or shower, does not reliably relieve the symptoms of croup and may not improve outcomes for children with this condition [0, 1, 2, 4]. Specifically, research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that high humidity did not improve symptoms for children with croup, and in some cases, inhaled moisture could even aggravate coughing, especially in children who are wheezing [1, 2]. Furthermore, there is a risk of scalding when using steam treatments, so they should only be used under careful supervision if attempted at all [0, 1]. Some parents and pediatricians have historically used steam from showers or baths as a home remedy, but this practice persists despite a lack of scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness [0, 1, 2]. In fact, some experts now recommend cool, moist air or taking the child outside into cool air as a more effective and safer alternative to steam [2, 3, 4].

qid_129,neutral,minoxidil balding hair growth,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,helpful,"Yes, minoxidil can treat hair loss and is one of the most widely used and scientifically supported treatments for this condition. Minoxidil is a vasodilator, which means it works by dilating blood vessels and increasing blood flow to the scalp, thereby delivering more nutrients and oxygen to hair follicles, which can help prevent hair loss and stimulate regrowth of hair strands [0, 1, 4]. It is FDA-approved for the treatment of hair loss and is available in various forms, including liquid, foam, cream, and tablet, making it accessible and easy to use for most people [0, 1, 2]. Clinical studies have shown that minoxidil is effective in stopping the loss of hair follicles and can also stimulate the regrowth of hair, particularly in cases of male and female pattern baldness [1, 2, 3]. For example, one study found that men using 5% minoxidil experienced a 55% increase in hair regrowth within five months, compared to a 25% increase with 2% minoxidil [3]. Minoxidil works by prolonging the anagen (growth) phase of the hair cycle, which is often shortened in individuals experiencing hair loss [2, 3]. However, it is important to note that minoxidil is not a cure for hair loss. Its effects are maintained only as long as the treatment is continued; if use is stopped, hair loss typically resumes [2, 4]. Additionally, while minoxidil can slow hair loss and promote regrowth, it may not fully restore hair in areas with significant thinning or a receding hairline, and results can vary between individuals [4]. Side effects are generally mild and manageable, but some users may experience initial shedding or irritation [0, 3]. In summary, minoxidil is a proven, effective, and accessible treatment for hair loss, especially for those with genetic forms such as male and female pattern baldness, but it requires ongoing use to maintain results and may not work equally well for everyone [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01507-of-07168.35872.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01882-of-07168.117431.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01882-of-07168.117431.md_7', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01882-of-07168.117431.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01968-of-07168.100593.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00494-of-07168.54286.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01507-of-07168.35872.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00494-of-07168.54286.md_1', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04723-of-07168.435.md_2', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03508-of-07168.34859.md_1']",neutral_helpful_vs_harmful_129,helpful

L-theanine is an amino acid found primarily in tea leaves and is well-researched for its calming and anti-anxiety effects without causing sedation or drowsiness [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Studies have shown that L-theanine increases the production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, which promotes relaxation and reduces anxiety by dampening excitatory signals in the brain [0, 1, 4]. Research demonstrates that L-theanine supplementation can significantly reduce the physiological response to stress, such as lowering heart rate and blood pressure during stressful situations [0, 2, 3, 4]. For example, a 2016 study found that a 200mg dose of L-theanine significantly reduced participants' response to stressful stimuli within an hour of ingestion, and also increased alpha brain wave activity, which is associated with a relaxed but alert mental state [1, 4]. Another study showed that L-theanine supplementation reduced the rise in blood pressure and heart rate in response to stress, further supporting its stress-reducing properties [0, 3, 4]. L-theanine's anti-anxiety effects are particularly noticeable in individuals with high baseline anxiety, and it has been shown to reduce both the mental and physical symptoms of stress [1, 2, 3, 4]. Additionally, L-theanine can promote a calm, attentive wakefulness, making it suitable for use during the day without impairing alertness or motor function [0, 2, 4]. Furthermore, L-theanine has been found to work synergistically with caffeine, reducing the negative effects of caffeine such as increased anxiety, while still providing cognitive benefits like improved attention and reaction time [0, 2, 4]. In summary, multiple studies and reviews support the use of L-theanine supplements for reducing stress and anxiety, promoting relaxation, and improving overall mental well-being without sedative side effects [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00498-of-07168.54836.md_23', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02978-of-07168.39832.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00498-of-07168.54836.md_26', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02978-of-07168.39832.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00568-of-07168.89598.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01023-of-07168.62264.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01845-of-07168.44388.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00630-of-07168.78305.md_4', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00199-of-07168.43173.md_1', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05650-of-07168.62751.md_3']",neutral_helpful_vs_harmful_131,helpful

Multiple studies and systematic reviews have shown that taking vitamin D supplements in addition to standard asthma medication is likely to reduce severe asthma attacks in both children and adults with asthma, especially among those with low baseline vitamin D levels [2, 4]. Specifically, pooled data from several clinical trials involving 955 asthma patients demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation resulted in a 30% reduction in the rate of asthma attacks treated with steroid tablets or injections (from 0.43 events per person per year to 0.30), and a 50% reduction in asthma attacks requiring emergency department attendance or hospitalization (from 6% to 3%) [1, 4]. The protective effect was even more pronounced in participants who had low vitamin D levels at the start of the studies, with a 55% reduction in the rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with steroid tablets or injections (from 0.42 events per person per year to 0.19) [1, 4]. Vitamin D is thought to help by boosting immune responses to respiratory viruses, which are common triggers for asthma attacks, and by reducing harmful inflammation in the airways [0, 4]. The supplementation was found to be safe, with no significant side effects such as changes in calcium levels or kidney stones reported [0, 3]. However, it is important to note that the majority of the evidence comes from studies involving adults with mild to moderate asthma, and people with severe asthma were underrepresented in these studies. Therefore, while the results are promising, they may not be fully generalizable to all asthma patients, and further research is needed for children and those with severe asthma [1, 3, 4]. In summary, vitamin D supplementation appears to be a safe, inexpensive, and potentially cost-effective strategy to help reduce the risk of severe asthma attacks, particularly in individuals with low vitamin D levels [0, 1, 3, 4].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00564-of-07168.90406.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00100-of-07168.122967.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00303-of-07168.65790.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00564-of-07168.90406.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00100-of-07168.122967.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00032-of-07168.131764.md_10', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00699-of-07168.80284.md_5', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00699-of-07168.80284.md_4', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04772-of-07168.84155.md_9', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04772-of-07168.84155.md_8']",neutral_helpful_vs_harmful_146,helpful
qid_149,neutral,hip osteoarthritis at-home exercises,Will at-home exercises manage hip osteoarthritis pain?,helpful,"Yes, at-home exercises can effectively help manage hip osteoarthritis pain. Exercise is considered the most effective non-drug treatment for osteoarthritis, as it increases blood flow and brings oxygen and nutrients to the cartilage in your joints, which helps them work better and last longer, while also easing symptoms such as pain, stiffness, and fatigue [1]. Strengthening exercises performed at home, such as chair stands, wall squats, and balance exercises, can support the muscles around the hip, thereby reducing pain and slowing further joint deterioration, [0, 1]. Range-of-motion exercises, which can also be done at home, help ease stiffness and restore flexibility, making movement easier for those with hip osteoarthritis, [0, 2]. Examples of at-home hip exercises include standing hip flexor stretches and knee-to-chest stretches, both of which can be performed with the support of a wall or chair if needed, [0, 2]. Additionally, low-impact aerobic activities such as walking, biking, and swimming are recommended for osteoarthritis sufferers and can be incorporated into a home exercise routine to further reduce joint stress and improve overall joint function,, [0, 1, 3]. Core exercises are also important, as they help stabilize and strengthen weight-bearing structures, reducing mechanical load on the hips, [3, 4]. It is important to start slowly, especially if you have not been exercising previously, and gradually increase the duration and intensity to avoid discomfort or injury, [0, 1]. In summary, consistent at-home exercise routines that include strengthening, range-of-motion, aerobic, and core exercises can substantially benefit people with hip osteoarthritis by reducing pain, improving function, and enhancing quality of life,,,, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. However, it is always advisable to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new exercise program [1].","['helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00945-of-07168.54620.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00945-of-07168.54620.md_0', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00945-of-07168.54620.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00083-of-07168.114295.md_2', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00491-of-07168.131203.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00867-of-07168.65223.md_3', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00630-of-07168.35835.md_1', 'helpful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00145-of-07168.35543.md_1', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04196-of-07168.126836.md_1', 'harmful_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04196-of-07168.126836.md_13']",neutral_helpful_vs_harmful_149,helpful
