Tepid sponge bathing is listed as an accepted first-line physical measure to help reduce fever in the acute setting, and it is reasonable to use this non-drug approach in children for comfort. The effectiveness of tepid sponging increases as more body surface area is wetted, and repeat wetting may be required to maintain the antipyretic effect [0]. Warm showers can further promote temperature reduction, and fanning provides a milder adjunct cooling effect that can be combined with tepid sponging [0]. Because fever can play a protective role, fever-lowering interventions—including external cooling—should not be pursued aggressively except in special circumstances such as patients in extremis or with seizures [0]. In practice, physical measures like tepid sponging can be tried before or alongside medications if the child is uncomfortable [0]. If nonpharmacologic measures are insufficient, antipyretics such as paracetamol may be used, with drug therapy ideally considered after physical measures have been attempted [0].

qid_103,neutral,folic acid dementia,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,"Short answer: Folic acid can improve aspects of cognition in certain groups and, when combined with vitamins B6 and B12, can slow brain atrophy in older adults with mild cognitive impairment and high homocysteine, but it is not an established stand‑alone treatment for dementia. Key evidence
- In older adults with mild cognitive impairment, high‑dose folic acid (0.8 mg/day) plus vitamins B12 (0.5 mg/day) and B6 (20 mg/day) for two years lowered homocysteine, slowed brain atrophy by about 30% on average, and in those with high baseline homocysteine cut atrophy by about half and improved multiple cognitive domains; benefits were stronger with higher omega‑3 status [0]. - In the FACIT trial, adults with raised homocysteine and normal B12 who took folic acid 800 micrograms/day for three years showed lower homocysteine and improved cognitive performance versus placebo [0]. - Observational studies link higher folate intake with lower Alzheimer’s risk and show that higher homocysteine increases dementia risk, while higher B12 is protective [0]. - In adolescents, higher folic acid intake correlated with better school grades, suggesting potential cognitive benefits beyond aging, though associations with homocysteine disappeared after adjusting for confounders [0]. - Dietary patterns rich in B vitamins (including folate) and omega‑3s are associated with better cognitive scores and less brain atrophy in very old adults [0]. - Animal and mechanistic data indicate that low folate/B‑vitamin status elevates homocysteine and can impair cognition via microvascular hippocampal changes [0]. What about treating established dementia? [0] - In mild Alzheimer’s, a multi‑nutrient drink containing B vitamins plus other nutrients improved delayed verbal recall but not global cognition over 12 weeks, indicating limited, domain‑specific effects rather than broad disease modification. - A small pilot in Alzheimer’s patients showed that high‑dose folic acid, B12, and B6 lowered homocysteine, but larger trials are needed to determine clinical benefit on disease progression [0]. - Overall, trials in established dementia show mixed and limited benefits, so folic acid (alone or with other B vitamins) is not a proven treatment for dementia at this time [0]. Important cautions
- High folate with low vitamin B12 can be associated with worse cognitive performance and higher anemia risk, so B12 status should be checked before supplementing folic acid, especially in older adults [0]. - Not all studies show benefit, and effects may depend on baseline homocysteine and omega‑3 status [0]. - While some countries fortify flour with folic acid, individualized supplementation should be guided by clinicians, with attention to B12 sufficiency and overall diet [0]. Bottom line: Folic acid can help improve cognition in select populations—particularly older adults with elevated homocysteine and adequate B12, and possibly adolescents—and, with B6 and B12, may slow brain atrophy in mild cognitive impairment, but it is not an established therapy for treating dementia [0].

In one English study, folic acid supplementation was associated with shorter hospital stays among mental hospital patients, though the absence of a control group limits the strength and generalizability of this finding [0]. Folic acid deficiency is often unrecognized in some elderly patients—particularly in nursing homes where folate‑rich vegetables may be inadequately provided or poorly tolerated—supporting consideration of supplementation when deficiency is suspected [0]. Consistent with this, supplementation with B‑complex vitamins that include folic acid, often alongside sublingual vitamin B12, may be helpful in institutionalized older adults suffering from senility or dementia [0]. Absorption issues are relevant in late life, as reduced gastric hydrochloric acid—common after age 60—impairs absorption of folic acid and vitamin B12, and correcting low acid has been reported to normalize absorption [0]. Because vitamin B12 deficiency can cause a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment, sometimes even without anemia, attention to B12 status alongside folate is important when using folic acid for cognitive complaints [0]. Overall, the evidence presented suggests folic acid can improve cognition in folate‑deficient individuals and may contribute to treatment plans for dementia, but the lack of controlled trials means benefits are most plausible when an actual deficiency is present rather than as a universal treatment [0].

qid_104,neutral,duct tape warts,Does duct tape work for wart removal?,"Yes—there is clinical evidence that duct tape occlusion therapy can remove common warts, and in one randomized controlled trial it outperformed cryotherapy in children and adolescents. In a prospective RCT of patients aged 3–22 years with common warts, complete resolution occurred in 85% of those treated with duct tape versus 60% with cryotherapy, a statistically significant difference [0]. In that study, most wart resolution with duct tape occurred within the first 28 days, and lack of response in the first two weeks predicted poor response to longer therapy [0]. The duct tape protocol used in the trial was: apply small pieces of duct tape to each wart and leave in place for six days (reapplying if it falls off), then remove the tape, soak the wart in water, gently debride with an emery board or pumice stone, leave off overnight, and reapply for another six days; repeat up to two months or until resolution [0]. Reported adverse effects with duct tape were mainly difficulty keeping the tape on and minor skin irritation, whereas cryotherapy commonly caused mild to severe pain during and after treatment [0]. The trial’s authors concluded duct tape occlusion was more effective, less expensive, and had fewer adverse effects than cryotherapy for common warts [0]. Contextual background in the same source notes that many warts resolve spontaneously over two years, and a range of treatments (cryotherapy, acids, laser, heat, tape occlusion) show variable cure rates (32–93%), often with higher cost, pain, or effort than duct tape [0]. The mechanism by which duct tape might work is not established in this context; hypotheses include local irritation that triggers an immune response, occlusion-related changes (e.g., moisture/temperature), or placebo effects, but no definitive mechanism is demonstrated here [0]. The evidence base described in this context is limited: it cites this single pediatric/young-adult RCT and mentions prior small, nonrandomized studies, so generalizability—especially to older adults—cannot be determined from this source alone [0]. Anecdotal reports in the same document describe both successes and failures, but these are not controlled data [0]. Practical cautions in the source include avoiding use on non-wart lesions (e.g., chalazion) and not taping eyelids [0]. Bottom line: Duct tape occlusion is a reasonable, low-cost, low-risk option with RCT evidence of benefit in children and adolescents, typically working within about a month if it is going to work, but its mechanism is uncertain and broader, adult-specific effectiveness is not established in this context [0].

A 2002 randomized, open-label trial in children found duct tape occlusion led to higher wart resolution than liquid nitrogen cryotherapy (85% vs [0]. 60%), with most duct tape–treated warts resolving within 28 days and only minor irritation reported. In some cases, applying duct tape to one wart was followed by resolution of distant warts, suggesting a possible systemic immune response [0]. However, this study had important limitations, including small sample size (N=51), unblinded design, poor follow-up, lack of confidence intervals, and potential bias in the cryotherapy protocol (nurse-applied, 10-second applications), which weakens confidence in the results [0]. When the Focht trial data were combined with similar studies, a 2012 Cochrane review found no significant benefit of duct tape therapy over placebo, and another review judged the overall evidence for duct tape to be low quality [0]. Thus, while duct tape is inexpensive, causes little pain, and can be used at home, its effectiveness is uncertain based on current evidence [0].

Limited clinical trials have failed to show lasting improvement of established hypertrophic or keloid scars with topical vitamin E [0]. Moreover, topical vitamin E can cause contact dermatitis that may delay healing, and early use may reduce the tensile strength of the scar, so its use is discouraged [0]. Over-the-counter scar products in general emphasize prevention and are unlikely to reverse well‑established keloids [0]. Evidence‑based options that can improve the appearance of hypertrophic and keloid scars include silicone elastomer sheeting, pressure dressings/garments, and intralesional corticosteroid injections, with cryotherapy useful for small lesions; however, established scars are difficult to treat and often recur, and adherence and follow‑up are essential [0]. When first‑line therapy fails, combination approaches such as surgery followed by corticosteroid injections and silicone sheeting (sometimes with pulsed dye laser) can reduce recurrence compared with surgery alone, though results vary and some modalities require specialist care [0].",unhelpful,neutral_harmful_qid_114_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00313-of-07168.64077.md,['doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00313-of-07168.64077.md'],unhelpful

The association was strongest among people whose overall diet closely matched the DASH pattern; in pooled analyses, those with high yogurt intake and high DASH adherence had a 31% lower risk compared with those with low yogurt intake and low DASH adherence [0]. Men in the cohorts consumed less yogurt, and the observed effects in men were weaker, possibly due to lower intake [0]. Other dairy foods such as milk and cheese also showed beneficial associations with blood pressure, though the effect of yogurt appeared stronger than other forms of dairy [0]. Investigators concluded that daily dairy intake—especially yogurt—lowers the risk of developing hypertension, which is a key risk factor for heart disease and stroke [0]. However, this research assessed risk of developing high blood pressure over time and did not evaluate whether yogurt lowers blood pressure in people who already have hypertension, nor did it specify yogurt types or serving sizes, so the findings pertain to prevention rather than treatment and cannot be generalized to all fermented milk products or to lowering existing blood pressure [0].",unhelpful,neutral_harmful_qid_117_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05709-of-07168.58436.md,['doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05709-of-07168.58436.md'],helpful

Yogurt is a fermented dairy product produced by Lactobacillus and Streptococcus acting on milk from animals (e.g., cows, goats, sheep, camels), and even plant-based milks can be fermented, linking its potential effects to fermentation and its bacterial content [0]. A proposed mechanism is that gut bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids that interact with a protein (Gp41) involved in blood pressure regulation, and yogurt provides both bacteria and fatty acids that could contribute to lower blood pressure [0].

However, its effect is limited to follicles that are currently undergoing miniaturization, and it does not work on follicles that are already completely miniaturized or on normal follicles, so it cannot fully reverse established hair loss [0]. For hair care, topical lotion is preferred over oral tablets to reduce side effects, and it should be applied to the scalp on dry hair and used continuously for best results [0]. Topical minoxidil is generally well tolerated, with side effects that often diminish over time [0]. Common adverse effects include allergic contact dermatitis, often due to propylene glycol in some formulations, with propylene glycol–free options available to lower this risk [0]. Facial hypertrichosis is uncommon in men and occurs more often in women, affecting about 3–7% of cases [0].

It is effective for about 50% of users, with better responses in people under 40 and those in the early stages of thinning (less than five years) [0]. For reasons not fully understood, women tend to respond slightly better than men [0]. The location of hair loss matters: the crown/vertex responds more reliably than the frontal scalp or hairline [0]. Treatment strength influences results, with 5% solutions outperforming 2% solutions in both hair mass and hair counts [0]. In studies, 5% led to about a 55% increase in hair mass at five months versus 25% with 2%, though this benefit declined over five years to 25% and 15% respectively [0]. Hair counts after 48 weeks increased by about 25 hairs/cm² with 5%, 21 hairs/cm² with 2%, and 9 hairs/cm² with placebo [0]. Some users also report meaningful regrowth over longer periods, though many describe new hairs as fine “peach fuzz.” Minoxidil has also been shown to shorten the duration of chemotherapy-induced alopecia with a 2% solution in a small study without significant side effects [0]. Its exact mechanism is unknown, but proposed actions include scalp blood vessel dilation and potassium channel opening, which may stimulate follicles [0]. Minoxidil for hair loss is applied topically, whereas oral formulations are higher dose and indicated for hypertension, not for alopecia [0]. Common experiences and side effects include an initial shedding phase, scalp irritation, itching/dandruff, and rarely dizziness or rapid heartbeat [0]. It should not be applied to irritated, injured, or sunburned scalp due to increased systemic absorption risk, and it is formulated for scalp use only [0]. Effects on a fetus are unknown and use is not advised while nursing, and some women (about 3–5% on 2% and higher on 5%) may develop unwanted facial or body hair (hypertrichosis) [0]. No animal or human studies indicate a cancer risk with minoxidil [0]. For best results, start as soon as thinning is noticed, recognize that women often respond better, consider the stronger solution if tolerated, limit sun exposure or wear a hat, and understand that results at five years are typically less robust than at one year [0]. Benefits depend on continued use, as stopping generally leads to loss of gains [0]. Cost for branded foam is roughly $50 for a three-month supply, and consumers should beware misleading products that simply repackage minoxidil or promote unproven herbal add-ons [0].

Minoxidil originated as a blood‑pressure medication; after patients noticed increased hair growth, it was marketed for men and women experiencing hair loss [0]. To properly stop and reverse hair loss, strategies that block DHT, improve nutrient supply via vasodilation, and clear blocked follicles are recommended rather than relying on minoxidil alone [0].

Minoxidil is a proven hair growth agent that was first introduced in 1988 after being observed to regrow hair as a side effect of its original use for hypertension [0]. The exact way it works is not fully understood; earlier theories focused on vasodilation, while more recent views categorize it as a potassium channel opener, and it does not affect hormone balance unlike finasteride or dutasteride [0]. Because it is non-hormonal and generally stimulates hair growth, it can be used for many forms of hair loss, not only androgenetic alopecia [0]. In clinical use, 60–80% of users experience stabilization of hair loss, though only about 30% achieve cosmetically satisfactory results, with best outcomes in recent hair loss and better efficacy on the crown than on a receding hairline, while new growth on long-standing bald spots is rare [0]. Minoxidil does not address underlying causes such as DHT-driven follicle miniaturization, so it may not be sufficient as a sole long-term strategy, and any gains are “minoxidil dependent,” requiring ongoing use to maintain results; stopping can lead to a rapid increase in hair loss [0]. Both men and women can benefit from minoxidil treatment [0]. It is generally regarded as safe, but side effects can include dry skin, fluid retention, dizziness, headaches, and increased body or facial hair from small amounts entering the bloodstream, and clinicians caution that it may be dangerous for people with cardiovascular disease [0].

It was approved by the FDA in 1988 to treat baldness (as Rogaine), with the agency noting it would not work for all customers (much less than 50%) and that observed regrowth was primarily in the crown area rather than the front hairline [0]. Minoxidil works by causing hairs in the telogen (resting) phase to shed, after which thicker hairs can grow during the anagen (growth) phase, and it is absorbed into the scalp, where it is converted to its active form and widens blood vessels to increase delivery of blood, oxygen, and nutrients to hair follicles [0]. It is available as a foam and topical solution, is not intended for use on the front of the scalp, and is not effective for receding hairlines [0]. You should allow at least four months to see potential hair growth, and many users may experience no positive effects at all [0]. Continuous, regular use may be required for conditions like male pattern baldness, whereas treatment might be stopped if the hair loss is temporary and growth returns to normal [0]. Side effects can include local burning, redness, and stinging at the application site; rare acne; rare facial hair growth; inflamed hair roots; and even worsened hair loss, with possible systemic effects from excess absorption such as blurred vision, lightheadedness, headaches, swollen hands or feet, rashes, and itching [0]. It should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and kept away from cats because it can be toxic to them [0].

The study reviewed 13 randomized controlled trials (10 in osteoarthritis and 3 in back pain) and found that paracetamol’s effect on pain and function in osteoarthritis was minimal, challenging its role as an effective symptomatic treatment [0]. Although many guidelines have recommended Tylenol as a first-line therapy, the researchers urge clinicians to rethink this endorsement given the limited efficacy demonstrated [0]. Safety is also a concern, as patients using paracetamol were four times more likely to have abnormal liver function tests compared with placebo, indicating an increased risk of liver toxicity [0]. The researchers suggest alternatives such as physical therapy—particularly strengthening exercises—and weight control as more effective strategies for managing osteoarthritis symptoms [0].",helpful,neutral_harmful_qid_143_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03192-of-07168.142130.md,['doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03192-of-07168.142130.md'],unhelpful
qid_143,neutral,tylenol osteoarthritis,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,"No; a large Canadian analysis of 74 randomized trials involving nearly 59,000 osteoarthritis patients found that acetaminophen (Tylenol), including Tylenol Arthritis, was no better than placebo at reducing osteoarthritis pain or improving mobility, with effects deemed clinically irrelevant [0]. Although acetaminophen is often recommended as a first-line therapy worldwide, the study’s lead author reported that the difference between acetaminophen and placebo for osteoarthritis pain was “minute” and not worthwhile, indicating it generally does not effectively manage osteoarthritis symptoms [0]. The study evaluated osteoarthritis only (not rheumatoid arthritis), so its conclusions apply specifically to osteoarthritis [0]. In that analysis, certain NSAIDs (e.g., diclofenac/Voltaren, etoricoxib/Arcoxia, rofecoxib/Vioxx) outperformed acetaminophen, but higher doses and longer use carry serious risks such as kidney failure, heart failure, stroke, and gastrointestinal bleeding, and these drugs are not intended for long‑term relief beyond a short period (around two weeks) [0]. Non‑drug strategies like regular physical therapy and gentle, joint‑friendly exercise (e.g., walking or water aerobics) were suggested, and patients may discuss joint replacement surgery with their doctors; opioids remain risky with questionable efficacy for osteoarthritis pain [0]. The maker of Tylenol disagreed with the authors’ interpretation and cited decades of studies supporting acetaminophen’s safety and efficacy, advising patients to consult their doctor or pharmacist if they have questions [0].",helpful,neutral_harmful_qid_143_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03929-of-07168.148346.md,['doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03929-of-07168.148346.md'],unhelpful

The document also warns that Tylenol carries significant safety risks, including liver toxicity and a dose-dependent increase in kidney failure risk with heavy use [0]. Accordingly, while Tylenol may be used for short-term symptom control, this source does not recommend it as a long-term management strategy [0].

In pooled analyses of randomized studies—including patients taking up to 4,000 mg/day for up to four weeks—reductions in pain and disability were small and did not translate into meaningful improvement for most patients [0].

It also cites a study in which consuming 40 grams of powdered sesame seeds daily for two months reduced knee osteoarthritis symptoms more than taking two 500-milligram doses of Tylenol per day, suggesting Tylenol can manage symptoms but may be less effective than sesame seeds in that trial [0].

A review of 13 clinical trials found average pain reductions of 4 points or less on a 0–100 scale—changes that are not considered clinically important [0]. In contrast, regular strength and flexibility exercise can yield larger pain reductions, with one study showing about a 2.3-point drop on a 0–10 scale (nearly five times the impact of acetaminophen) [0]. Effective alternatives for lower-limb osteoarthritis include land- and water-based exercises, strength training, weight management, and oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, as appropriate [0].

The same review explicitly states that, because the quality of evidence for depression is very low, it is unclear what impact music interventions actually have on depression [0]. There was no observed difference between music therapy and music medicine in their effects on depression in the included trials [0]. Overall, the authors recommend considering music interventions in psychosocial cancer care due to benefits in anxiety, pain, fatigue, and quality of life, but they do not conclude a clear benefit for depression given the evidence limitations [0]. No adverse effects of music interventions were reported in the included studies [0]. Most trials had a high risk of bias, and more rigorous research is needed to determine the effect on depression [0].

Individual trials have been inconclusive, but pooled analyses of several randomized trials suggest vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of severe asthma attacks, particularly among people who start with lower vitamin D levels [0]. Conversely, large-scale genetic analyses found no causal effect of lower 25‑hydroxyvitamin D on asthma, leading the authors to conclude that vitamin D supplements will probably not help asthma or atopic dermatitis in general [0]. Preventive high‑dose vitamin D during pregnancy did not reduce the risk of doctor‑diagnosed asthma in children by age six, indicating prenatal supplementation is not effective for preventing childhood asthma [0]. Because respiratory viral infections commonly trigger asthma exacerbations, vitamin D’s potential to enhance antiviral immunity has been investigated, and pooled analyses across many trials explored whether particular groups benefit more, though results across studies have been conflicting [0]. Overall, these findings suggest vitamin D supplementation is not a universal treatment for asthma, but correcting deficiency may help reduce severe exacerbations in selected patients while standard asthma therapies remain the cornerstone of management [0]. Specific dosing recommendations and formal guideline positions on using vitamin D for asthma management are not provided in the context references [0].

However, the outcomes studied were new diagnoses of osteoarthritis and hip replacement over time, not pain relief or symptom improvement from exercise, and the study did not evaluate structured at-home exercise programs for people with existing hip osteoarthritis [0]. Therefore, based on this context alone, it is not possible to determine whether at-home exercises will manage hip osteoarthritis pain [0]. The same analysis also noted that nonrunning exercise was associated with small increases in osteoarthritis and hip replacement risk per unit of exercise independent of BMI, which further underscores that the study’s focus was risk, not pain management, and that effects may vary by activity type [0]. In summary, while staying active and maintaining a lower BMI were linked to lower osteoarthritis and hip replacement risk among runners, the document does not provide direct evidence on whether at-home exercises manage hip osteoarthritis pain [0].",helpful,neutral_harmful_qid_149_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04244-of-07168.68158.md,['doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04244-of-07168.68158.md'],unhelpful
qid_149,neutral,hip osteoarthritis at-home exercises,Will at-home exercises manage hip osteoarthritis pain?,"At-home exercise can help reduce hip osteoarthritis pain to a modest extent, but effects are generally small and the evidence for exercise alone is more limited than for multimodal physiotherapy programs that combine exercise with manual therapy and education [0]. A systematic review of land‑based exercise for hip osteoarthritis found a small favorable effect on pain but no clear benefit for self-reported physical function [0]. Another review concluded there was insufficient evidence to claim that exercise therapy alone is an effective short‑term approach for improving pain, function, and quality of life [0]. Conversely, a meta‑analysis reported that therapeutic exercise—especially programs incorporating hands‑on training and strengthening—can be efficacious for hip osteoarthritis pain, suggesting strengthening-focused programs may offer benefit [0]. In a randomized trial comparing manual therapy with therapist‑supervised exercise, both groups improved though manual therapy achieved higher success rates, indicating exercise can help but may be less effective than manual therapy alone [0]. Contemporary physiotherapy typically combines individualized manual therapy, home exercises, and education, and this multimodal approach with home exercises performed several times per week is being tested over 12 weeks with maintenance at 6 months [0]. Practical home programs often include hip abductor and quadriceps strengthening, targeted stretching, and balance or gait drills performed three to four times weekly, ideally prescribed and progressed by a physiotherapist [0]. Set realistic expectations for modest pain relief from home exercise alone and consider combining it with therapist‑guided manual therapy, activity advice, and, if indicated, a gait aid for greater overall benefit [0].
