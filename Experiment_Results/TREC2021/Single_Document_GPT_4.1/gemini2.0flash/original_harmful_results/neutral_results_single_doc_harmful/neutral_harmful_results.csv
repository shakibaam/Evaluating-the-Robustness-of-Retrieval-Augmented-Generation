In naturopathic practice, tepid (81–92°F) or neutral (93–96°F) sponge baths are considered safe and easy to implement at home for young children, and they are often used to improve comfort rather than to aggressively lower body temperature [0]. However, the effectiveness of tepid sponging as a method to control fevers is not strongly supported by high-quality evidence. A 2003 Cochrane review found that tepid sponging did help to reduce fevers in children in a few small studies, but subsequent reviews have found insufficient evidence to support tepid sponging as a reliable method for fever control [0]. Therefore, while tepid sponge baths may provide some benefit in terms of comfort and temporary reduction of fever, they should not be relied upon as the primary or sole method for managing fever in children [0]. It is important to note that the primary goal in fever management should be to address the child’s comfort rather than to focus solely on achieving a normal body temperature, as fever itself is a beneficial immune response and not inherently dangerous in most cases [0]. Caregivers should monitor for signs of dehydration, irritability, activity level, and feeding, and consult a healthcare provider if there are concerns about the child’s condition [0]. In summary, tepid sponge baths can be a safe and supportive measure to help reduce fever and improve comfort in children, but their effectiveness is limited and not strongly supported by robust clinical evidence [0].

qid_103,neutral,harmful,folic acid dementia,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,"There is substantial evidence that folic acid, a B vitamin, plays an important role in cognitive function and may help in both improving cognition and potentially treating or delaying dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. Much of the research has focused on older adults, where adequate levels of folate and vitamin B12 have been shown to be important for maintaining cognitive functioning as people age [0]. High levels of homocysteine, an amino acid in the blood, are associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, as well as with greater brain atrophy [0]. Low levels of folate and vitamin B12 are linked to higher homocysteine levels, and B vitamins are required to convert homocysteine back to methionine, thereby reducing its levels [0]. Mouse studies have shown that increased homocysteine impairs cognition through microvascular changes in the hippocampus, a brain region critical for memory [0]. Several human studies support the cognitive benefits of folic acid. For example, a randomized controlled trial found that older adults with mild cognitive impairment who received high doses of B vitamins (including folic acid) experienced a significantly slower rate of brain atrophy, especially those with high baseline homocysteine levels [0]. In this study, brain atrophy was cut by half in the group with high homocysteine who received B vitamins, and there were clear benefits in episodic memory, semantic memory, and global cognitive function [0]. Another study found that folic acid supplementation (800 micrograms daily for three years) in older adults with raised homocysteine and normal B12 levels led to lower homocysteine and improved cognitive performance compared to placebo [0]. Epidemiological studies have also shown that higher dietary intake of folate is associated with less cognitive decline and a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease [0]. For instance, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging found that those who consumed at least 400 mcg of folate per day had a 55% reduction in Alzheimer's risk [0]. Additionally, a Swedish study found that low levels of vitamin B12 or folate were associated with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in elderly individuals [0]. Folic acid is also crucial for brain development, which is why pregnant women are urged to take supplements, and some countries fortify bread and flour with folic acid [0]. In adolescents, higher folic acid intake has been linked to better academic achievement, suggesting cognitive benefits beyond old age [0]. However, not all studies have found consistent benefits, and some research suggests that the cognitive benefits of folate may depend on adequate vitamin B12 status; high folate with low B12 may be associated with poor cognitive performance and a greater probability of anemia [0]. Therefore, it is important to maintain adequate levels of both folate and vitamin B12. In summary, folic acid can help improve cognition and may help delay or reduce the risk of dementia, particularly when combined with adequate vitamin B12 and in individuals with elevated homocysteine levels [0]. However, more research is needed to determine the optimal dosing and to clarify the effects in different populations. It is generally recommended to achieve adequate folate intake through a balanced diet, and supplementation should be considered with caution, especially in the context of vitamin B12 status [0].",unhelpful,['doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05020-of-07168.56629.md'],neutral_harmful_qid_103_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05020-of-07168.56629.md,doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05020-of-07168.56629.md,helpful

For example, scientists in England found that supplementing the diets of patients with folic acid resulted in shorter stays at their mental hospital, although it is important to note that this study was not controlled and therefore its findings should be interpreted with caution [0]. Residents of nursing homes and chronic wards of mental hospitals are at considerable risk for folic acid deficiency, and research shows that this deficiency is often unrecognized in some elderly patients [0]. Therefore, supplementation with B-complex vitamins, including folic acid, may be helpful to those in nursing homes suffering from senility or dementia [0]. Additionally, a deficiency of hydrochloric acid (HCl) production in the stomach, which is common in people age 60 and older, can impair folic acid absorption, further increasing the risk of deficiency and its associated cognitive symptoms [0].

qid_103,neutral,harmful,folic acid dementia,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,"Folic acid may play a role in improving cognition and potentially treating dementia, as suggested by several lines of evidence. Epidemiological studies and case observations have indicated that low concentrations of folate in the blood are related to poor cognitive function, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease, implying that adequate folate status may be important for maintaining cognitive health and reducing the risk of dementia [0]. It has been hypothesized that the relationship between folate deficiency and poor cognitive function may be due to folate’s role in reducing homocysteine levels in the blood, which can affect the vascular system and, consequently, brain health [0]. Furthermore, studies suggest there is an association between mental vitality, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and the folate status of the brain [0]. A decline in folate levels in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) with age has been recognized, and there is evidence causally relating folate levels to mental function, especially depression and dementia [0]. Folate deficiency can contribute to depressed mood, and therefore folate supplementation may be useful for some depressed patients [0]. However, while these associations are supported by observational and mechanistic studies, it is important to note that the context does not provide definitive evidence that folic acid supplementation alone can treat dementia. Rather, it suggests that maintaining adequate folate levels may help support cognitive function and potentially reduce the risk or severity of cognitive decline and dementia [0]. As always, individuals should consult with healthcare professionals before starting any supplementation, especially in the context of treating medical conditions such as dementia.

However, the study did not include participants with Alzheimer's disease, and it is still too early to conclude whether folic acid or other nutrients can actually prevent the onset of Alzheimer's or serve as a treatment for dementia [0]. Experts recommend that everyone maintain a diet rich in heart-healthy foods, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, to support overall brain health, as these foods provide a steady supply of essential nutrients, including folic acid [0]. While folic acid supplements are available and included in many multivitamin formulas, it is important to consult a doctor before taking them, as excessive intake may cause serious side effects in some individuals [0]. Additionally, experts suggest that if you take a folic acid supplement, it should also contain vitamin B-12, since high doses of one can mask a deficiency of the other, and vitamin B-12 may also provide brain benefits [0].

Some studies in animals suggest that high homocysteine and low folic acid may make brain cells more vulnerable to damage from beta-amyloid, a protein linked to Alzheimer's, and that homocysteine itself may be directly toxic to brain cells [0]. Additionally, a Dutch study reported that older adults who took high doses of folic acid supplements (800 micrograms a day) were less likely to suffer from memory decline as they aged, but in the U.S. study, doses above the RDA did not provide additional benefit [0]. Despite these findings, it is still too early to recommend folic acid or other B vitamins as a routine preventive or treatment for Alzheimer's or dementia, as many questions remain unanswered and other lifestyle factors may also play a role [0]. The best current advice is to follow a heart-healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and to consult a doctor before taking supplements, especially since excessive folic acid can mask symptoms of vitamin B-12 deficiency, which is common in the elderly [0]. In summary, while folic acid may help reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's, there is no conclusive evidence that it can improve cognition or treat dementia once it has developed [0].",unhelpful,['doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02066-of-07168.81524.md'],neutral_harmful_qid_103_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02066-of-07168.81524.md,doc_en.noclean.c4-train.02066-of-07168.81524.md,unhelpful

However, other researchers consider such deficiencies to be of only minor importance, and little is known about whether supplementation with folic acid would significantly help people with this disease [0]. Therefore, while there is some evidence of an association between folic acid deficiency and dementia, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that folic acid supplementation can improve cognition or treat dementia [0].

However, two other studies found no benefit to using duct tape, but those studies used clear duct tape rather than the standard silver type, which is stickier and has a different kind of adhesive [0]. Given this limited and conflicting evidence, if you plan to try duct tape, it makes sense to use the silver kind [0].

A prospective, randomized controlled trial compared duct tape occlusion therapy to cryotherapy (freezing with liquid nitrogen) in patients aged 3 to 22 years with common warts (verruca vulgaris) [0]. In this study, 85% of the warts treated with duct tape completely resolved, compared to 60% in the cryotherapy group, and this difference was statistically significant [0]. The duct tape was applied for six days at a time, removed, the wart soaked and debrided, and then the tape reapplied, repeating this cycle for up to two months or until the wart resolved [0]. Most warts treated with duct tape resolved within the first 28 days of therapy [0]. Duct tape therapy is considered less expensive and less painful than cryotherapy, with fewer adverse effects; the main issues reported were difficulty keeping the tape on and minor skin irritation [0]. In contrast, cryotherapy often caused mild to severe pain at the treatment site [0]. The exact mechanism by which duct tape works is not fully understood, but several theories exist. One hypothesis is that the occlusion and mild irritation caused by the tape stimulate a local immune response, allowing the body to recognize and attack the wart virus more effectively [0]. Another theory is that the tape deprives the wart of oxygen or creates a moist environment that weakens the wart tissue, making it easier for the immune system to clear the infection [0]. Some have speculated about chemical components in the adhesive, but there is no definitive evidence for this [0]. Numerous anecdotal reports and patient experiences also support the effectiveness of duct tape for wart removal, often describing warts shrinking, turning white, and eventually falling off, sometimes leaving a small crater that heals over time [0]. However, it is important to note that not all warts respond to duct tape therapy, and results may vary depending on the individual and the type of wart [0]. In summary, duct tape is a low-cost, relatively painless, and often effective method for removing common warts, with clinical studies and many patient testimonials supporting its use [0].

According to recent mouse studies, there is scientific evidence suggesting that withholding nutrition (or ""starving"") may be beneficial in certain bacterial infections that induce fever, such as those caused by the bacterium Listeria. In these studies, mice infected with Listeria that were forced to eat—even a small amount—had a higher mortality rate, and glucose alone was enough to worsen their condition and lead to death. This effect was not due to an inability to clear the infection, but rather to harmful changes in metabolism triggered by the presence of glucose during bacterial inflammation. Therefore, in the case of some bacterial infections, ""starving"" may indeed be effective and even protective for the host organism, at least in mice models [0]. However, the same studies found the opposite to be true for viral infections such as influenza. Mice infected with the influenza virus had improved survival rates when they were provided with additional nutrition, particularly glucose. When these mice were deprived of glucose, they lost the ability to regulate vital functions such as body temperature, breathing, and heart rate, leading to worse outcomes. Thus, ""starving"" a fever caused by a viral infection may actually be harmful, while ""feeding"" may be beneficial [0]. It is important to note that these findings are based on animal studies, and the researchers caution that mice are not humans. More research, including human clinical trials, is needed to determine the optimal nutritional approach for people with fever due to different types of infections. Until such evidence is available, the traditional advice to ""starve a fever"" should be applied with caution, and it is essential to distinguish between bacterial and viral causes of fever before making dietary decisions [0].",unhelpful,['doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00847-of-07168.120896.md'],neutral_harmful_qid_108_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00847-of-07168.120896.md,doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00847-of-07168.120896.md,helpful

Research has shown that low selenium levels are linked with an increased risk of death from cancer and all causes, while higher selenium levels are associated with a lower risk of certain cancers, particularly colorectal cancer in women, as well as breast, lung, esophageal, gastric, and prostate cancers [0]. A 2016 meta-analysis of 69 studies found that high selenium exposure from food (but not from supplements) had a protective effect on cancer risk and decreased the risk of several types of cancer [0]. One of the most notable studies, conducted by Dr. Larry Clark, found that taking 200 micrograms of selenium daily for about seven years reduced the occurrence of cancer by 42 percent compared to a placebo group, and cancer deaths were cut almost in half [0]. Specifically, men who took selenium had 63 percent fewer prostate cancers, 58 percent fewer colorectal cancers, 46 percent fewer lung cancers, and an overall 37 percent reduction in cancers [0]. The reductions were so significant that the blinded phase of the trial was stopped early, and no cases of selenium toxicity occurred [0]. The anti-cancer effects of selenium are thought to be due to its antioxidant properties, its ability to regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis (programmed cell death), trigger DNA repair in damaged cells, suppress the growth of blood vessels supplying nutrients to tumors, and inhibit tumor cell invasion [0]. Selenium may also boost immune system function, which can help the body eliminate early cancers [0]. However, it is important to note that while selenium from food sources appears to be beneficial, excessive intake from supplements may have risks, and the research on selenium supplementation is still evolving [0]. Therefore, it is generally recommended to obtain selenium from a varied diet rich in whole, unprocessed foods [0].",unhelpful,['doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05482-of-07168.110108.md'],neutral_harmful_qid_109_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05482-of-07168.110108.md,doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05482-of-07168.110108.md,helpful
qid_109,neutral,harmful,selenium cancer,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,"There is substantial evidence suggesting that selenium may help prevent certain types of cancer. Selenium is a dietary-essential trace element that plays a critical role in the body's defense against cancer and other illnesses involving free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [0]. Numerous studies, including mechanistic, animal, epidemiological, and clinical supplementation trials, have demonstrated that selenium supplementation can reduce cancer incidence and mortality [0]. A landmark randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical study known as the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer (NPC) trial showed that daily supplementation with 200 micrograms of selenium yeast reduced cancer mortality by 50%, lung cancer deaths by 53%, total cancer incidence by 37%, and the incidence of prostate and colon cancer by 63% and 58%, respectively [0]. Additional studies have found that higher selenium intake is associated with a lower risk of advanced prostate cancer, with one study reporting a 65% reduced risk in those with the highest selenium intake compared to those with the lowest [0]. Selenium is present in the active sites of several enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase, which have antioxidant properties and may encourage cancerous cells to undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) [0]. Selenium also improves immune system function, induces the formation of natural killer cells, and can decrease the rate of tumor growth [0]. Furthermore, animal studies have shown that selenium-rich foods, such as Brazil nuts, are as effective as selenium supplements in reducing the incidence of mammary and colon cancers in rats [0]. Epidemiological studies have also indicated that poor selenium status, especially in men, is a risk factor for cancer, particularly prostate cancer, while higher selenium levels are protective [0]. However, while the evidence is promising, the context document notes that there is currently no definitive proof for an anticancer effect of selenium in humans, and more research is needed to confirm these findings [0]. The recommended daily intake for selenium to prevent deficiency is 55 micrograms, but for maximal protection against certain cancers, a total daily intake of 200-300 micrograms may be necessary, though intake should not exceed the upper limit of 400 micrograms per day to avoid toxicity [0]. In summary, selenium appears to have a protective effect against several types of cancer, particularly prostate, colon, and lung cancers, based on a variety of scientific studies, but definitive proof in humans is still lacking and further research is warranted [0].",unhelpful,['doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01220-of-07168.44004.md'],neutral_harmful_qid_109_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01220-of-07168.44004.md,doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01220-of-07168.44004.md,helpful

According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the International Journal of Cancer Management, increased selenium levels are associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer. Specifically, individuals in the highest quintile of selenium exposure had an odds ratio (OR) of 0.55 (95% CI: 0.35 to 0.86, P < 0.01) for developing lung cancer compared to those in the lowest quintile, indicating a significant protective effect of higher selenium levels against lung cancer incidence [0]. The meta-analysis included 15 high-quality studies (13 case-control and 2 cohort studies) with a total of 84,199 subjects, and found that both serum and toenail selenium concentrations were significantly lower in lung cancer patients compared to healthy controls. The standardized mean difference (SMD) between serum selenium concentrations in lung cancer and healthy groups was -0.32 μg/L (95% CI: -0.53 to -0.11, P = 0.003), and for toenail selenium it was -0.13 μg/g (95% CI: -0.22 to -0.03, P = 0.006), further supporting the association between higher selenium status and lower lung cancer risk [0]. The study also notes that selenium is a fundamental trace element involved in important metabolic pathways, including the antioxidant defense system and the immune system. Selenium is an essential component of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which helps neutralize harmful oxidative products and free radicals, potentially reducing cellular damage that can lead to cancer [0]. However, the review also highlights that results from individual studies have been contradictory, with some studies not finding a significant association between selenium levels and cancer risk. Additionally, the authors caution that selenium's effects may depend on dose and metabolic activity, and that in high concentrations, some selenium compounds may even have pro-oxidant or carcinogenic effects [0]. In conclusion, the current evidence from this meta-analysis supports a preventive role for increased selenium levels in the incidence of lung cancer, suggesting that selenium could be used as a predictive variable for lung cancer risk.

Animal studies further support this, as genetically modified mice deficient in selenoproteins exhibited accelerated development of prostate cancer, while supplementation with selenium compounds inhibited prostate cancer and increased survival in these models [0]. Selenium has also been shown to prevent colon cancer in animal studies. Mice with genetically impaired selenoprotein expression who were given dietary selenium had reduced colon cancer and fewer pre-neoplastic lesions, and similar results were observed in chemically induced colon cancer models [0]. Regarding breast cancer, several studies indicate that lower selenium levels are found in women with breast cancer compared to healthy controls, both in Japanese and American populations [0]. Supplementation with selenium has been shown to reduce tumor incidence in animal models of breast cancer [0]. Furthermore, selenium supplementation is particularly beneficial for women with BRCA1 gene mutations, which are associated with a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer.

Selenium deficiency has been linked to a two- to three-fold increase in overall cancer risk, particularly for cancers of the bladder, esophagus, lung, stomach, and liver, and is associated with an eight-fold increase in thyroid cancer risk due to its importance in proper thyroid functioning [0]. There are three main forms of selenium with cancer-fighting properties: L-selenomethionine, selenium-methyl L-selenocysteine, and sodium selenite. L-selenomethionine, an organic compound of selenium, has been shown to reduce cancer risk by up to 50 percent and specifically lower the risk of lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers by 37 percent [0]. Further research has indicated that L-selenomethionine supplementation could reduce prostate cancer rates by 63 to 74 percent, depending on individual histories and prostate-specific antigen levels [0]. Additionally, selenium-methyl L-selenocysteine inhibits tumor growth by preventing the formation of new blood vessels in tumors, while sodium selenite destroys cancer cells by producing toxic reactive oxygen species that selectively target tumor cell mitochondria without harming healthy cells [0]. Selenium helps prevent cancer through several mechanisms, including suppressing inflammatory molecules that promote cancer growth, reducing oxidative stress with antioxidants, eliminating carcinogenic toxins and heavy metals, and preventing DNA alterations [0].

Zinc is an essential micronutrient involved in numerous biological processes, including cellular division, differentiation, and antioxidant functions, making it crucial for successful embryogenesis and fetal development [1, p. 7]. During pregnancy, the requirement for zinc increases, especially in the third trimester, and plasma zinc concentrations naturally decline as pregnancy progresses [1, p. 13]. Many pregnant women, especially in developing countries, may not meet the daily requirement for zinc through diet alone, which can lead to adverse outcomes such as prolonged labor, fetal growth restriction, or even embryonic or fetal death [1, p. 13]. Randomized controlled trials have shown that zinc supplementation can have beneficial effects. For example, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in African-American women found that those who received 25 mg of zinc per day from 19 weeks gestation had significantly greater birth weights and head circumferences compared to the placebo group, highlighting the importance of adequate zinc supply during pregnancy [1, p. 13]. Other studies in populations with high rates of zinc deficiency have reported benefits such as reduced incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension and low birth weights with zinc supplementation [1, p. 13]. However, the benefits of zinc supplementation in well-nourished populations or in developed countries are less clear, with some studies showing conflicting results [1, p. 13]. Zinc deficiency has also been associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia, and lower serum zinc concentrations have been observed in women with preeclampsia compared to healthy controls [1, p. 14]. Supplementation may therefore be particularly beneficial in populations at risk of zinc deficiency or where preeclampsia is a concern. In summary, zinc supplementation during pregnancy can improve outcomes such as birth weight and may reduce the risk of certain complications, especially in populations where zinc deficiency is prevalent.

The account emphasizes that creating a warm, moist environment, such as a steamy bathroom, is one of the first steps taken to treat croup symptoms at home, as the moist air can help ease breathing and reduce the severity of the cough. Additionally, moving from a warm, steamy environment to a cooler one, such as stepping outside, can also help soothe a croupy cough.

Minoxidil works by producing a vasodilation effect, which improves micro-circulation in the scalp and enhances cellular proliferation, as well as lengthening the growth phase of hair (anagen phase) [0]. By regulating the hair follicle growth cycle, minoxidil can reverse the hair miniaturization process that is present in androgenic baldness, but its action is limited to follicles that are undergoing miniaturization; it does not work on follicles that are already completely miniaturized or on normal follicles, meaning it cannot reverse hair loss in those cases [0]. Minoxidil can be used orally or topically, but for hair care, topical application is preferred to reduce side effects [0]. For best results, the lotion should be applied continuously to the scalp with dry hair [0]. Generally, minoxidil is well tolerated when applied topically, with few side effects that tend to decrease over time [0].",helpful,['doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04694-of-07168.58343.md'],neutral_harmful_qid_129_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04694-of-07168.58343.md,doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04694-of-07168.58343.md,helpful

Minoxidil is the main ingredient in many mainstream hair loss products, such as Rogaine, and it works by opening ATP-sensitive potassium channels in hair follicles, which increases hair growth through the dermal papilla [0]. Studies have shown that minoxidil is effective in reducing hair loss and promoting hair regrowth, particularly in cases of male pattern baldness [0]. However, the hair growth effect of minoxidil is generally short-term, as it creates minoxidil-dependent hairs that may shed once the treatment is stopped [0].

It is most effective for individuals with androgenic alopecia (male or female pattern baldness), particularly those under the age of 40 who have only recently begun to experience hair thinning (less than five years) [0]. The medication works best when applied as soon as hair loss is noticed, especially at the crown or vertex of the scalp, as these areas are more responsive to treatment than the frontal hairline [0]. Clinical studies have shown that minoxidil works for about 50 percent of patients who try it, with women generally experiencing slightly better results than men [0]. The strength of the minoxidil formula also matters: a 5 percent solution has been shown to produce a greater increase in hair mass and hair count compared to a 2 percent solution, although the benefits tend to diminish over time [0]. For example, after five months of use, the 5 percent solution produced a 55 percent increase in hair mass, compared to a 25 percent increase with the 2 percent solution; however, after five years, these increases dropped to 25 percent and 15 percent, respectively [0]. Another study found that the 5 percent solution resulted in 25 additional hair follicles per square centimeter, compared to 21 with the 2 percent solution and 9 with a placebo after 48 weeks [0]. Minoxidil is also effective in reducing the duration of hair loss caused by chemotherapy, as demonstrated in a study involving women undergoing breast cancer treatment, where the 2 percent topical solution decreased the duration of alopecia without significant side effects [0]. The exact mechanism by which minoxidil promotes hair growth is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve the dilation of blood vessels and the opening of potassium channels, which may stimulate hair follicles [0]. Minoxidil is applied topically as a cream or foam, and oral forms are only approved for treating hypertension, not hair loss [0]. There are some side effects associated with minoxidil, including initial increased hair shedding, scalp irritation, itchiness, dandruff, and, rarely, dizziness or rapid heartbeat [0]. It is not recommended for use on irritated, injured, or sunburned scalps, and its effects on pregnant or nursing women are not well known [0]. Some women may experience unwanted hair growth on the face or body, particularly with the higher-strength solution [0]. In summary, minoxidil can treat hair loss, especially in cases of androgenic alopecia, but its effectiveness is limited and depends on early and consistent use, the strength of the formula, and individual factors such as age and gender [0].

As a result, while minoxidil may temporarily promote hair growth, its effects do not last indefinitely, and it does not stop hair loss in the long term [0]. Over time, the amount of hair lost may exceed the amount of hair regrown with minoxidil, making baldness more apparent [0]. Therefore, minoxidil can help stimulate hair growth and slow hair loss temporarily, but it is not a cure and does not treat the underlying causes of hair loss [0].

For example, a pooled analysis of data from seven separate trials involving 955 asthma patients found that vitamin D supplementation could protect against asthma attacks overall when data from all trials were combined, and that people with lower vitamin D levels to start with might particularly benefit from supplementation [0]. However, other studies have not found significant benefits. A large genetic study involving over 100,000 individuals found no statistically significant difference in rates of asthma (including childhood-onset asthma) between people with genetic alterations associated with lower vitamin D levels and those without such alterations, suggesting that vitamin D supplementation may not have a major impact on asthma or atopic dermatitis [0].

Another systematic review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to suggest that exercise therapy alone can be an effective short-term management approach for reducing pain levels, improving function, or enhancing quality of life in individuals with hip OA [0]. However, a meta-analysis that included both land-based and water-based exercise programs found more favorable results, concluding that therapeutic exercise—especially when it includes specialized hands-on training and strengthening components—is an efficacious treatment for hip OA pain [0]. This suggests that while at-home exercises may provide some pain relief, their effectiveness is likely enhanced when combined with other interventions such as manual therapy and professional supervision. Furthermore, in the context of a multimodal physiotherapy program, participants are prescribed home exercises to be performed multiple times per week, and adherence to these exercises is monitored as part of the treatment protocol [0].
