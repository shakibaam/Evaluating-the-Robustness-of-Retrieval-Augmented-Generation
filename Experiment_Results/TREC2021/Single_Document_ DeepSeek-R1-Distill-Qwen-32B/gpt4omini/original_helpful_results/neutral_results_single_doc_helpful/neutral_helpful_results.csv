qid_102,neutral,tepid sponge bath reduce fever children,Is a tepid sponge bath a good way to reduce fever in children?,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether a tepid sponge bath is a good way to reduce fever in children. I remember that sometimes people use sponge baths when someone has a fever, but I'm not sure if it's effective or recommended. Let me think about this step by step. First, I should consider what a tepid sponge bath entails. It's using lukewarm water to sponge down the body, usually to lower body temperature. I think the idea is that the water evaporates and helps cool the skin, which in turn might help lower the internal temperature. But is this method effective? I'm not sure. I've heard that sometimes it's used in hospitals, but I also remember reading that it might not be the best approach. Maybe it's more about comfort than actually reducing fever. I should also think about the alternatives. The main treatments for fever in children are antipyretics like acetaminophen (paracetamol) and ibuprofen. These are medications that help reduce fever by affecting the body's temperature regulation. They're commonly recommended by doctors because they're effective and have been studied extensively. Wait, but the question is about a tepid sponge bath specifically. I think I've heard that physical methods like sponge baths aren't as effective as medications. Maybe they can provide some temporary relief, but they don't actually lower the fever in a significant way. I should also consider any potential risks. Using a sponge bath with water that's too cold could cause shivering, which might actually raise the body temperature. That's counterproductive. So, the water needs to be just right—tepid, not cold. But even then, it might not be very effective. Another point is comfort. Sponge baths can be uncomfortable for the child, especially if they're already feeling unwell. It might not be the best way to make them feel better, especially if it doesn't effectively lower the fever. I also recall that some guidelines or studies might have looked into this. Maybe there's research that compares sponge baths with other methods. If I remember correctly, some studies suggest that sponge baths aren't very effective and might not be worth the effort, especially since there are better options available. So, putting it all together, while a tepid sponge bath might offer some temporary comfort, it's not an effective method for reducing fever in children. The preferred methods are antipyretic medications, which are both safe and effective when used correctly. Sponge baths might be used in certain situations, but they shouldn't be the go-to method for fever management. </think>  A tepid sponge bath is not an effective method for reducing fever in children. While it may provide temporary comfort, it does not significantly lower body temperature and can be uncomfortable for the child. The preferred methods for fever management are antipyretic medications like acetaminophen and ibuprofen, which are both effective and safe when used as directed. Sponge baths should not be the primary method for fever reduction and are generally not recommended for this purpose. **Answer:**   A tepid sponge bath is not an effective method for reducing fever in children. While it may offer temporary comfort, it does not significantly lower body temperature and can be uncomfortable. The preferred methods are antipyretic medications, which are safe and effective. Sponge baths are not recommended as the primary method for fever management.",unhelpful,neutral_helpful_qid_102_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.03202-of-07168.59992.md,[],unhelpful

qid_103,neutral,folic acid dementia,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether folic acid can help improve cognition and treat dementia. I'm not very familiar with this topic, but I'll try to break it down step by step. First, I know that folic acid is a type of vitamin, specifically B9. It's important for various bodily functions, including the production of red blood cells and DNA synthesis. I've heard it's often recommended during pregnancy to prevent birth defects, but I'm not sure about its role in brain health. The user provided some context references, so I should look through those to find relevant information. Let me go through each reference one by one. The first reference is about the Vitamin B12 test. It mentions that folate is usually tested alongside vitamin B12. It also notes that vitamin B12 deficiency can be caused by a vegetarian or vegan diet. While this is useful, it doesn't directly address folic acid's impact on cognition or dementia. The second reference is from Lab Tests Online about vitamin B12 and folate. It explains why and when to get tested for these vitamins. It says that low levels of vitamin B12 or folate can cause megaloblastic anemia, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, and other symptoms. However, it doesn't discuss cognitive functions or dementia. The third reference is from myDr.com.au about pernicious anemia, which is related to vitamin B12 deficiency. It mentions that this condition can cause neurological symptoms, but again, it's more about the deficiency itself rather than the benefits of supplementation. The fourth reference is from the Cochrane Library, titled ""No evidence of the efficacy of vitamin B12 supplementation for cognitive function."" This seems more relevant. It states that while vitamin B12 is essential for the nervous system, the relationship between B12 and cognitive function isn't fully understood. The review found that there's no statistically significant effect of B12 supplementation on cognition in people with dementia or cognitive impairment and low B12 levels. This suggests that B12 alone might not help with cognitive issues. The fifth reference is another Cochrane review titled ""No evidence that folic acid with or without vitamin B12 improves cognitive function of unselected elderly people with or without dementia. Long-term supplementation may benefit cognitive function of healthy older people with high homocysteine levels."" This is directly related to folic acid. It says that folic acid, with or without B12, doesn't improve cognitive function in the general elderly population. However, long-term supplementation might help those with high homocysteine levels, which is a risk factor for cognitive decline. The sixth reference is from the Australian Prescriber about measuring vitamin D, which isn't directly relevant here. The seventh reference is another Cochrane review about treatments for anemia in pregnancy. It mentions that iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12 are important for preventing anemia during pregnancy. While this is about pregnancy, it shows that folic acid is recognized as important for blood health, but not specifically for cognition. The eighth reference is about postnatal depression and dietary supplements, including folic acid. It suggests that deficiencies in certain nutrients, including folic acid, might contribute to postnatal depression, but this is a different context from dementia. The ninth reference is a Cochrane review on folic acid supplementation in pregnancy, which again is about preventing birth defects and anemia, not cognition. The tenth reference is about procaine and anti-aging effects, which isn't relevant. The eleventh reference is about testing for coeliac disease, which is unrelated. Putting this all together, the most relevant information comes from the two Cochrane reviews. The first one about B12 shows no significant cognitive benefits. The second one about folic acid indicates that it doesn't help the general elderly population but might help those with high homocysteine levels. So, to answer the question: Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia? Based on the provided references, it seems that folic acid alone doesn't improve cognitive function in most elderly people. However, in specific cases where homocysteine levels are high, long-term supplementation might offer some benefits. But overall, the evidence doesn't strongly support folic acid as a treatment for dementia or cognitive decline in the general population. I should make sure to cite the relevant Cochrane reviews in the answer to back up these points. Also, it's important to note that while folic acid is crucial for other health aspects, its role in cognitive health isn't as clear-cut. </think> Based on the provided references, folic acid does not appear to significantly improve cognition or treat dementia in the general elderly population.

However, the evidence regarding its effectiveness in improving cognition and treating dementia is mixed and not fully conclusive. Research has shown that folic acid plays a role in reducing homocysteine levels in the blood, which is associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline and dementia [0]. High levels of homocysteine have been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia [1]. Therefore, maintaining adequate levels of folic acid through diet or supplementation may help in reducing this risk. However, studies examining the direct impact of folic acid supplementation on cognitive function in individuals with dementia have yielded inconsistent results. A Cochrane review found that there was no statistically significant effect of folic acid supplementation on cognitive function in people with dementia or cognitive impairment, even when combined with vitamin B12 [2]. Another study suggested that long-term supplementation with folic acid might benefit cognitive function in healthy older people with high homocysteine levels, but this effect was not observed in unselected elderly populations [3]. It is important to note that while folic acid is generally safe and well-tolerated, excessive intake can lead to side effects such as gastrointestinal disturbances and, in rare cases, neurological issues [4]. Therefore, supplementation should only be considered under medical supervision, especially in individuals with pre-existing conditions or those taking other medications. In summary, while folic acid is crucial for overall cognitive health and may help in reducing the risk of cognitive decline associated with high homocysteine levels, there is limited evidence to support its use as a standalone treatment for improving cognition or treating dementia. Further research is needed to establish definitive guidelines on the role of folic acid in cognitive health and dementia management. </think>  Folic acid, a form of vitamin B9, is essential for various bodily functions, including the maintenance of cognitive health.

qid_103,neutral,folic acid dementia,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether folic acid can help improve cognition and treat dementia. I remember that folic acid is a B-vitamin, specifically B9, and it's important for various bodily functions. From what I've read before, it's often mentioned in the context of preventing birth defects, especially neural tube defects in babies. But I'm not sure about its role in cognitive functions or dementia. I think I should start by understanding what folic acid does in the body. It helps in the production of red blood cells and plays a role in DNA synthesis. It's also involved in homocysteine metabolism. High levels of homocysteine have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and possibly cognitive decline. So, if folic acid lowers homocysteine levels, maybe it can have a protective effect on the brain. Now, regarding cognition and dementia, I recall that some studies have looked into B-vitamins, including folic acid, as potential treatments or preventive measures. I think there was a study where they gave B-vitamins to people with mild cognitive impairment and saw some benefits, but I'm not sure if that included folic acid specifically or if it was a combination of vitamins. I should also consider the Cochrane reviews mentioned in the context. One of them talks about homocysteine-lowering interventions, which include B-complex vitamins like folic acid. They found that while lowering homocysteine might help with cardiovascular issues, the evidence for cognitive benefits isn't strong. Another Cochrane review specifically on folic acid and cognitive function in the elderly didn't find significant benefits either. Wait, but there's also something about folic acid supplementation in pregnancy. It's known to prevent neural tube defects, but does that have any long-term cognitive benefits? I don't think that's directly related to treating dementia in adults. I should also think about the dosage and how folic acid is administered. Some studies use high doses, while others use standard supplements. Maybe the effectiveness depends on the dosage or the population being studied. For example, people with a deficiency might see more benefits than those who are already getting enough from their diet. Another point is that folic acid is often taken in combination with other B-vitamins, like B12. Since they work together in the body, it's possible that the effects seen in studies are due to the combination rather than folic acid alone. This makes it harder to isolate the specific role of folic acid in cognitive health. I also remember reading that while folic acid can lower homocysteine levels, this doesn't always translate to improved cognitive outcomes. There might be other factors at play, such as the presence of other nutrients or the overall health of the individual. In summary, based on the context provided, it seems that folic acid alone isn't a definitive treatment for improving cognition or treating dementia. While it plays a role in homocysteine metabolism and overall brain health, the evidence from systematic reviews doesn't strongly support its use for cognitive enhancement or dementia treatment. However, it's still important for general health, especially in preventing deficiencies and related conditions. </think>  Folic acid, a form of vitamin B9, is essential for various bodily functions, including red blood cell production, DNA synthesis, and homocysteine metabolism. Elevated homocysteine levels have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and cognitive decline. While folic acid can lower homocysteine levels, this does not necessarily translate to improved cognitive outcomes. Several studies and Cochrane reviews have examined the role of folic acid and B-vitamins in cognitive function and dementia. A Cochrane review on homocysteine-lowering interventions, which include folic acid, found limited evidence supporting cognitive benefits, despite potential cardiovascular benefits. Another review specifically on folic acid supplementation in the elderly also did not find significant cognitive improvements. Folic acid is often used in combination with other B-vitamins, such as B12, and the observed effects may be due to this synergy rather than folic acid alone. Additionally, the effectiveness of folic acid might depend on dosage and the population studied, with benefits more pronounced in those with deficiencies. In conclusion, while folic acid is crucial for general health and preventing deficiencies, the evidence does not strongly support its use as a definitive treatment for improving cognition or treating dementia. It remains important for overall health, particularly in preventing conditions like neural tube defects in pregnancy.",unhelpful,neutral_helpful_qid_103_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.05825-of-07168.47791.md,[],unhelpful

qid_104,neutral,duct tape warts,Does duct tape work for wart removal?,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether duct tape works for removing warts. I remember hearing somewhere that duct tape might be effective, but I'm not sure if that's actually true. Let me think about this step by step. First, I should consider what warts are. They're caused by a virus called HPV, right? And they can appear on different parts of the body. People often look for home remedies because some treatments can be expensive or have side effects. Duct tape is something many people have at home, so it makes sense that it's been considered as a possible treatment. I recall reading an article a while back that mentioned a study where duct tape was used for warts. The study suggested that it was effective, but I also remember that the results weren't consistent in later studies. That makes me wonder if the initial study was flawed or if there are other factors at play. Maybe the way the duct tape was applied varied between studies, affecting the outcome. Another thing to consider is how duct tape might work. Some people think it's because the tape suffocates the wart, cutting off its supply of oxygen. Others believe it's the adhesive that helps, maybe by irritating the skin and prompting the immune system to fight the virus. I'm not sure which theory is more plausible, but it's something to think about when evaluating the effectiveness. I should also look into alternative treatments. The article mentioned that there are more effective treatments available. These might include over-the-counter medications like salicylic acid, which works by peeling away the layers of the wart. There are also prescription options, such as stronger acids or freezing treatments (cryotherapy). Additionally, some people might opt for laser treatment or surgery if the warts are particularly stubborn or painful. It's also important to note that warts can sometimes go away on their own without any treatment. This is because the immune system can eventually recognize and fight off the HPV virus. However, this can take time, and some people prefer to take action rather than wait it out. So, putting this all together, while there was some initial evidence suggesting that duct tape might help with wart removal, subsequent studies haven't been able to consistently replicate those results. This means that while it might work for some people, it's not a reliable or proven method. More effective treatments are available, and sometimes warts resolve on their own. I should also consider the potential downsides of using duct tape. For example, if the tape is left on too long or if it's not applied properly, it could cause skin irritation or damage. It's also not a quick fix, as it might take several weeks of consistent application to see any results, if any at all. In conclusion, while duct tape has been studied as a possible treatment for warts, the evidence supporting its effectiveness is inconsistent and not strong enough to recommend it as a reliable method. It's better to consider other, more proven treatments or consult a healthcare professional for advice tailored to individual cases. </think>  Duct tape has been studied as a potential treatment for warts, with some initial research suggesting it might be effective. However, subsequent studies have not consistently replicated these results, indicating that while it might work for some individuals, it is not a reliable or proven method for wart removal [0].

qid_105,neutral,put ice on a burn,Should I apply ice to a burn?,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether I should apply ice to a burn. I remember hearing conflicting advice about this, so I want to make sure I get it right. Let me start by recalling what I know about burns and first aid. Burns can be classified into different degrees based on their severity. First-degree burns are the mildest, affecting only the outer layer of the skin, causing redness and pain. Second-degree burns go deeper, causing blisters and more intense pain. Third-degree burns are the most severe, damaging all layers of the skin and possibly underlying tissues, muscles, and bones. I think the general advice for minor burns is to cool them down, but I'm not sure if ice is the best method. I've heard that applying ice directly can cause further damage, like frostbite, because it's too cold. Instead, using cool water or a clean cloth soaked in cool water might be better. Looking at the context provided, the user shared a blog post by Dr. Chris Baker about sunburns and their effects. In that post, Dr. Baker discusses the prevention and treatment of sunburns, which are a type of burn caused by UV radiation. He mentions that severe cases of erythema (sunburn) can result in blisters and fever, classified as second-degree burns. He advises seeking medical care for such cases, including possible intravenous fluids and avoiding certain treatments until the skin heals. Dr. Baker also talks about the Fitzpatrick Scale, which categorizes skin types based on their response to sun exposure. This might be relevant because different skin types have varying tolerances to heat and cooling methods. In the context, Dr. Baker doesn't explicitly mention using ice for burns, but he does discuss the importance of hydration and avoiding certain therapies until the skin has healed. He emphasizes that severe burns require medical attention and that treatments like stretching or massage should be avoided until the skin is healed. So, putting this together, it seems that for minor burns, using cool water or a clean, cool compress is appropriate. However, ice should be avoided because it can cause further damage. For more severe burns, especially those involving blisters or deeper tissue damage, medical attention is necessary, and home treatments like ice or even some ointments might not be suitable. I should also consider other sources of information. The American Red Cross advises against using ice on burns because it can lead to hypothermia or frostbite. Instead, they recommend running cool (not cold) water over the burn for 10-15 minutes or until the pain subsides. For more severe burns, they stress the importance of seeking professional medical help immediately. Another point to consider is the duration of cooling. Applying ice for too long can be harmful, but using cool water for a moderate amount of time is generally safe. Additionally, covering the burn with a sterile bandage after cooling can help prevent infection, but this should be done gently without breaking any blisters. In summary, while cooling a burn is important, using ice directly is not recommended. Instead, cool water or a clean, cool compress should be used. For severe burns, medical attention is crucial, and certain treatments should be avoided until the skin has started to heal. </think When dealing with a burn, it is important to approach the situation carefully to avoid further injury.

qid_105,neutral,put ice on a burn,Should I apply ice to a burn?,"Okay, so the user is asking whether they should apply ice to a burn. I need to figure out the answer based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again to find relevant information. Looking at the context, there's a section titled ""10 First Aid Mistakes to Avoid..."" which includes a point about burns. Specifically, point 1 says that applying butter or ice on a burn is not advisable. It explains that ice is too harsh and can cause further damage. Instead, cool running water should be used for at least 10-20 minutes. So, from this, I can gather that applying ice directly to a burn is not recommended. The context also mentions that if it's a severe burn, one should go to the ER immediately. I should structure the answer to clearly state that ice shouldn't be applied, explain why (harshness, further damage), and provide the correct method (cool water). Also, I need to cite the source properly using IEEE format, which in this case is reference . I need to make sure each sentence is properly cited and the answer is comprehensive [0]. I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward. </think> No, you should not apply ice directly to a burn. Applying ice to a burn can cause further damage because it is too harsh on the affected skin [0]. Instead, the recommended approach is to cool the burn immediately by running cool water over the area for at least 10 to 20 minutes. This helps to mitigate internal damage caused by retained heat [0]. If the burn is severe and exposes muscle, it is crucial to seek immediate medical attention rather than attempting home remedies [0].",unhelpful,neutral_helpful_qid_105_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01692-of-07168.118775.md,['doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01692-of-07168.118775.md'],unhelpful

A randomized controlled trial conducted by Manocha et al. evaluated the effectiveness of Sahaja yoga as an adjunctive therapy for asthma in adults who remained symptomatic despite moderate to high doses of inhaled steroids [0]. The study found that Sahaja yoga led to a significant improvement in airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) compared to a control intervention. Specifically, the improvement in AHR was 1.5 doubling doses greater in the yoga group than in the control group (p=0.047) [0]. Additionally, the yoga group showed greater improvements in the mood subscale of the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS) compared to the control group [0]. These findings suggest that Sahaja yoga may have beneficial effects on both objective and subjective measures of asthma management. However, the study also noted that these improvements were not sustained at the 2-month follow-up assessment, possibly due to reduced adherence to yoga practices after the intervention period [0]. Overall, while Sahaja yoga shows promise as a complementary therapy for asthma, further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying its effects and to determine its long-term clinical value. </think>  Yes, yoga can improve the management of asthma, particularly Sahaja yoga, which is a form of meditation based on yogic principles.

For instance, a randomized controlled study on 241 patients with mild to moderate persistent chronic bronchial asthma found that the yoga group experienced significant improvement in their biochemical profile and a decrease in asthma symptom scores compared to the control group [0]. Additionally, another study reported that regular practice of pranayama and yoga breathing can increase respiratory stamina, relax chest muscles, expand lungs, and calm the body, which are all beneficial for asthma management [0]. Furthermore, the context highlights that yoga can be used as an adjunct therapy to conventional treatments for asthma. For example, a study involving sixty patients showed that lung functions improved significantly after two months of yoga practice, indicating the positive impact of yoga on respiratory efficacy [0]. Another study concluded that yoga practice can reduce the frequency of rescue medication use in asthmatic patients, suggesting that yoga may help in reducing reliance on asthma medications [0]. In summary, the evidence from the context strongly supports the use of yoga, particularly pranayama and jalaneti, as a complementary therapy for improving the management of asthma. These practices can enhance respiratory function, reduce asthma symptoms, and potentially decrease the need for asthma medications when used alongside standard medical treatments.",helpful,neutral_helpful_qid_107_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00097-of-07168.111102.md,['doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00097-of-07168.111102.md'],helpful

qid_108,neutral,"starve a fever, feed a cold",Is starving a fever effective?,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether starving a fever is effective. I remember hearing the saying ""feed a cold, starve a fever,"" but I'm not sure if there's any real science behind it. Let me think about this step by step. First, I should consider what causes a fever. Fevers are usually a response to an infection, like a virus or bacteria. The body's temperature rises to fight off the pathogens. So, when someone has a fever, their body is working hard to recover. Now, the advice to ""starve a fever"" suggests that not eating might help. But why would that be the case? Maybe because the body needs energy to fight the infection, so not eating could redirect resources towards the immune system. But that doesn't sound quite right. I think the body actually needs energy to function, especially when it's fighting an illness. Looking at the context provided, the article mentions a study where volunteers who fasted showed an increase in an immune response targeting bacteria, which can cause fevers. However, the study was small and involved healthy people, so it's not a solid basis for treatment recommendations [0]. That makes me think that while there might be some immune response changes when fasting, it's not enough evidence to support starving a fever as an effective treatment. The article also points out that children with fevers need light and nourishing food to help them recover. This makes sense because providing the body with nutrients can support the immune system and help the child feel better. Starving might not give the body the necessary resources to fight the infection effectively. Additionally, the article talks about the importance of staying hydrated, especially for children with fevers. Keeping fluids up is crucial to prevent dehydration. If someone is starving a fever, they might not be getting enough fluids, which could be harmful. So, putting this all together, starving a fever doesn't seem to be effective. The body needs nutrients and fluids to recover, and while there's some research suggesting fasting might affect certain immune responses, it's not enough to recommend starving as a treatment. The traditional advice might have some roots in historical practices, but modern understanding supports feeding, not starving, when someone has a fever. </think>  The effectiveness of starving a fever is not supported by sufficient evidence. Here's a structured summary of the reasoning: Understanding Fever **: Fevers are the body's response to infection, often caused by viruses or bacteria. The body increases its temperature to combat pathogens. **Origin of Advice**: The saying ""feed a cold, starve a fever"" suggests that fasting might aid in fighting a fever. However, this advice lacks robust scientific backing. **Immune Response and Fasting**: A small study mentioned in the context showed that fasting increased an immune response targeting bacteria, which can cause fevers. However, this study was limited in scope and involved healthy individuals, making it insufficient for treatment recommendations . 4 [0]. **Nutritional Needs**: The body requires energy and nutrients to fight infections. Providing light, nourishing food supports the immune system and aids recovery. Starving may deprive the body of necessary resources. **Hydration Importance**: Staying hydrated is crucial, especially for children with fevers, to prevent dehydration. Fasting could lead to inadequate fluid intake, which is harmful. **Conclusion**: Starving a fever is not effective. The body benefits from nutrients and fluids to recover. While fasting might influence certain immune responses, it is not recommended as a treatment. Modern understanding supports feeding, not starving, during a fever. **Answer**: Starving a fever is not effective. The body needs nutrients and fluids to recover, and while fasting may influence immune responses, it is not supported by sufficient evidence for treatment.

qid_109,neutral,selenium cancer,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether selenium helps prevent cancer. I remember reading somewhere that selenium is an essential nutrient, but I'm not sure about its role in cancer prevention. Let me start by recalling what I know about selenium. It's a trace element found in soil and certain foods, and it's important for various bodily functions, including the immune system and thyroid function. I think selenium has antioxidant properties, which might help protect cells from damage. Antioxidants are often linked to cancer prevention because they can neutralize free radicals that might otherwise damage DNA and lead to cancer. But I'm not sure if selenium specifically has been proven to do this. Looking at the context provided, there's a section discussing selenium and cancer. It mentions that the proposed mechanism of action is through the production of methylselenol, which affects gene expression and modifies cell cycling. That sounds like it could have anti-cancer effects, but I need to see if there's evidence supporting this. The context also refers to a Cochrane review evaluating the effect of selenium on cancer. The review included observational studies and randomized controlled trials. It found limited evidence linking high selenium levels with a protective effect against cancer. The authors caution that selenium might be a surrogate marker for a healthy lifestyle, meaning that people with high selenium levels might just be healthier overall, not necessarily because of selenium itself. Additionally, the review noted that observational studies can be misleading, as they might not account for other factors. This makes me think that while there's some suggestion that selenium could help, the evidence isn't strong enough to recommend it for cancer prevention. Another point from the context is that selenium supplementation isn't universally beneficial. It depends on individual selenium status. For people with low selenium levels, supplementation might be helpful, but for those with adequate or high levels, it could be harmful due to the risk of toxicity. So, putting this together, selenium's role in cancer prevention isn't clearly established. While there are some promising mechanisms and observational data, clinical trials haven't provided conclusive evidence. Therefore, it's not recommended as a primary strategy for preventing cancer. Instead, maintaining a balanced diet rich in various nutrients, including selenium, is probably a better approach. I should also consider the potential risks of selenium supplementation. The context mentions that selenium has a narrow safe range, and excessive intake can lead to toxicity. This reinforces the idea that individualized approaches are necessary, and that supplementation shouldn't be a one-size-fits-all solution. In summary, while selenium has some potential benefits related to cancer prevention, the evidence isn't robust enough to support its use as a preventive measure. More research is needed to understand its specific effects and to determine who might benefit from supplementation. </think The role of selenium in cancer prevention is not definitively established. While selenium, an essential trace element, has antioxidant properties that could theoretically protect cells from DNA damage, the evidence supporting its use in cancer prevention is limited. Observational studies suggest a potential association between higher selenium levels and reduced cancer risk, but these findings may be confounded by other healthy lifestyle factors rather than selenium itself [0]. A Cochrane review evaluating selenium's impact on cancer found limited evidence and cautioned against interpreting selenium levels as a direct protective factor [0]. Additionally, selenium supplementation is not universally beneficial; it depends on individual selenium status, with potential risks of toxicity at high levels [0]. Therefore, while selenium may have some potential benefits, it is not recommended as a primary strategy for cancer prevention. A balanced diet rich in various nutrients, including selenium, is a more prudent approach.

qid_110,neutral,birth control pill ovarian cysts treatment,Will taking birth control pills treat an ovarian cyst?,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether taking birth control pills will treat an ovarian cyst. I'm not entirely sure, but I remember hearing that ovarian cysts are pretty common, especially in women of reproductive age. I think they can form for various reasons, like during the menstrual cycle when an egg is released. But sometimes, these cysts can cause problems, so people might look into treatments like birth control pills. First, I should understand what ovarian cysts are. From what I know, they're fluid-filled sacs that develop on the ovaries. There are different types, like functional cysts, which are usually harmless and go away on their own. Then there are other types, like endometriomas or cystadenomas, which might be more concerning. I think the context provided mentions something about polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which involves multiple cysts. Now, the question is about using birth control pills to treat these cysts. I remember reading that birth control pills regulate the menstrual cycle and prevent ovulation. Since ovulation can sometimes lead to the formation of functional cysts, maybe preventing ovulation could help reduce the occurrence of these cysts. But does that mean they can treat existing cysts? Looking at the context, it says that birth control pills are often prescribed to regulate cycles in PCOS patients. However, it also mentions that this isn't the best treatment because it doesn't address the underlying cause. Instead, natural progesterone is recommended as a better alternative. So, while BCPs can help with symptoms like irregular periods, they might not be the most effective treatment for the cysts themselves. The context also talks about how BCPs work by inhibiting ovulation, which is the primary defect in PCOS. But by doing so, they might just mask the problem rather than solve it. This makes me think that while BCPs can manage some symptoms, they might not actually treat the cysts effectively. They could prevent new cysts from forming, but existing ones might still be an issue. Additionally, the context mentions that BCPs can worsen insulin resistance and diabetes, which are often associated with PCOS. This suggests that relying on BCPs might not be ideal for long-term management, especially considering the metabolic aspects of PCOS. So, putting this together, it seems that while birth control pills can help regulate menstrual cycles and prevent new cysts from forming by inhibiting ovulation, they aren't a definitive treatment for existing ovarian cysts. They might manage some symptoms but don't address the root cause, especially in conditions like PCOS where the underlying issue is anovulation and hormonal imbalances. I should also consider other treatments mentioned in the context, like natural progesterone, which is suggested as a better alternative. Progesterone therapy can help restore normal hormonal balance and might be more effective in treating the underlying cause of the cysts rather than just managing symptoms. In conclusion, birth control pills can play a role in managing ovarian cysts by preventing ovulation and regulating cycles, but they aren't a complete treatment. They might be useful in certain cases, but for more effective and long-term management, especially in conditions like PCOS, other treatments like progesterone therapy might be more appropriate. </think>  Birth control pills (BCPs) can help manage ovarian cysts by preventing ovulation and regulating menstrual cycles, but they are not a definitive treatment for existing cysts.

qid_111,neutral,zinc supplements pregnancy,Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy?,"The question of whether taking zinc supplements improves pregnancy is complex and depends on various factors such as the mother's nutritional status, the presence of deficiencies, and the specific context of the pregnancy. Based on the provided context, here is a detailed analysis:  1. **Zinc's Role in Pregnancy**: Zinc is essential for fetal growth and development. Deficiencies in zinc during pregnancy have been linked to complications such as preterm birth and low birth weight . 2. **Impact of Zinc Supplementation**: Studies have shown that zinc supplementation can have beneficial effects [0]. For instance, in a study conducted in Nepal, zinc supplementation was found to reduce the risk of acute diarrhea and impetigo in low birth weight infants [0]. However, the benefits may vary depending on the population and the presence of other micronutrient deficiencies. **Combined Micronutrient Supplementation**: The context also mentions that multiple micronutrient supplements, including zinc, did not show a significant improvement in neonatal morbidity compared to iron and folic acid alone [0]. In some cases, multiple micronutrient supplements were associated with an increased risk of birth asphyxia, though the mechanisms remain unclear . 4 [0]. **Maternal Zinc Status**: The effectiveness of zinc supplementation may also depend on the mother's baseline zinc levels. In populations where zinc deficiency is prevalent, supplementation is more likely to yield positive outcomes . 5 [0]. **Conclusion**: While zinc supplementation can be beneficial in certain contexts, particularly in populations with zinc deficiencies, it may not universally improve pregnancy outcomes. The decision to use zinc supplements should be based on individual nutritional assessments and guided by healthcare professionals. In summary, zinc supplements can improve pregnancy outcomes in specific scenarios, particularly when there is a deficiency, but their use should be tailored to individual needs and circumstances [ </think The question of whether taking zinc supplements improves pregnancy is complex and depends on various factors such as the mother's nutritional status, the presence of deficiencies, and the specific context of the pregnancy.

qid_111,neutral,zinc supplements pregnancy,Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy?,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether taking zinc supplements will improve pregnancy. I'm not a medical expert, but I'll try to break this down based on the information provided. First, I'll look at the context given. The context is about zinc sulfate, which is a form of zinc supplement. It mentions that zinc is important for growth and development of body tissues. It's used to treat and prevent zinc deficiency. So, zinc is essential, but how does that relate to pregnancy? The context also talks about side effects, which include allergic reactions and upset stomach. It mentions that if you're pregnant, you shouldn't use zinc sulfate without a doctor's advice. That's a red flag because it suggests that while zinc is important, taking supplements might not be straightforward during pregnancy. I also see that the context advises consulting healthcare providers before taking zinc sulfate, especially if you have certain medical conditions. Since pregnancy is a medical condition that requires careful management, this reinforces the idea that self-medicating with zinc supplements isn't advisable. Another point is about dietary intake. The context suggests consulting the Office of Dietary Supplements or the USDA Nutrient Database for information on recommended dietary allowances. This implies that getting enough zinc through diet might be preferable or at least as effective as supplements, but again, under medical supervision. The context also warns about interactions with other medications and foods high in calcium or phosphorus, which can interfere with zinc absorption. This could complicate matters further if someone is taking other supplements or medications during pregnancy. Putting this all together, it seems that while zinc is important for health and development, taking zinc supplements during pregnancy isn't something to take lightly. The potential risks and the need for professional medical advice are emphasized. Therefore, the answer should reflect that while zinc is beneficial, the use of supplements during pregnancy should be discussed with a healthcare provider to ensure safety and appropriateness. </think>  Taking zinc supplements during pregnancy should be approached with caution and under the guidance of a healthcare provider. Zinc is essential for growth and development, and while it is important for health, the use of zinc supplements, such as zinc sulfate, is not recommended without medical advice during pregnancy [0].

Results indicated that 24% and 18% of Dupixent-treated adolescents achieved clear or almost-clear skin, compared to 2% with placebo (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0007) [ Additionally, 41.5% and 38% achieved 75% skin improvement, versus 8% with placebo (p < 0.0001) [ Dupixent also improved itching and EASI scores, with 66% and 65% improvement in EASI and 48% and 45.5% in pruritus scores in the Dupixent groups [0]. The safety profile was consistent with adult studies, with no serious adverse events or discontinuations . While Dupixent is effective for adults and adolescents, its use in children under 12 is not yet approved [0, 0]. Thus, Dupixent is indicated for adults and adolescents aged 12 and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis not controlled by topical therapies .

The approval is specifically for adults whose condition is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when such therapies are not advisable [0]. Dupixent works by inhibiting the overactive signaling of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13), two key proteins involved in Type 2 inflammation. This mechanism helps reduce the inflammation associated with atopic dermatitis, leading to improvements in skin symptoms and overall quality of life . The efficacy of Dupixent in treating eczema has been demonstrated in clinical trials [0]. For instance, data from trials published in The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine have shown significant reductions in disease severity, improvements in skin clearance, and a reduction in the need for corticosteroid use among patients treated with Dupixent . It is important to note that Dupixent is also approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe asthma in certain patient populations, and its use in other conditions, such as chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, is under investigation [0, 0].

I remember that croup is a condition that affects children, causing a barking cough and some breathing issues. The user provided a context reference from Verywell Health, which I can use to answer this question. Looking at the context, under the ""Treatment"" section, it mentions that many healthcare providers suggest exposing the child to moist or humid air, like from a hot shower or a humidifier. However, it also clearly states that there's no evidence showing that moist air actually helps. So, while steam is commonly recommended, it doesn't have scientific backing. I should structure my answer to first explain what croup is, then discuss the treatment options mentioned, specifically addressing the use of steam. I need to make sure to cite the source properly using IEEE format. Each sentence that references the context should have the citation in brackets. I also need to ensure that the answer is complete and covers all relevant points from the context. It's important to mention that while steam is a common remedy, it's not supported by evidence, and other treatments like steroids or epinephrine might be used in severe cases. I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward. Each paragraph should be concise, and the answer should flow logically from one point to the next. Let me outline the key points:  1. Definition of croup and its symptoms. 2. Common treatments suggested, including steam. 3. The lack of evidence supporting steam's effectiveness. 4. Mention of other treatments used in severe cases. 5. Conclusion that steam is not proven to help but is a common suggestion. Now, I'll translate these points into a coherent answer, making sure each sentence is properly cited and the information is accurate based on the provided context. </think> Croup is a common childhood condition characterized by a barking cough and stridor, which is a raspy breathing sound caused by swelling in the upper airway near the vocal cords [0].

In fact, they warned that inhaled moisture could make coughing worse for children who are wheezing. They also noted that home humidifiers can be contaminated with bacteria or fungi, which is a safety concern. The article goes on to say that even if there is some benefit from steam, the particles from a regular shower or humidifier might not be the right size to reach the inflamed area in the child's airway. This makes me think that while steam might feel comforting, it might not be doing much to treat the actual cause of the croup. Pediatricians are mentioned as suggesting steamy bathrooms as a first step, but if that doesn't help, they recommend trying cold night air. Some doctors even suggest having the child suck on a Popsicle to reduce coughing. This makes me wonder if the comfort of being held by a parent in a warm, steamy environment might be more beneficial than the steam itself. The article also mentions that croup is usually a mild viral illness and that most children get better on their own. So, maybe the steam isn't necessary, and the body just needs time to recover. However, if symptoms are severe, like labored breathing or the child can't speak or cry, parents should go to the ER.

I remember that croup is a respiratory issue, especially in kids, causing a barking cough and breathing difficulties. But I'm not sure about the effectiveness of steam. Let me think through this. First, I should recall what croup is. From what I know, croup is usually caused by a viral infection, often parainfluenza virus. It affects the upper airways, leading to swelling and narrowing of the air passages, which causes the characteristic barking cough and stridor (a high-pitched breathing sound). Now, the question is about using steam from a shower to help with croup. I've heard some people suggest using steam for respiratory issues, like how humidifiers are used for colds. But does it actually help with croup? I think I remember reading that for croup, especially in mild cases, sometimes cool or moist air can help. Maybe that's where the steam idea comes from. But I'm not sure if it's effective or recommended. Looking at the context provided, the article mentions that giving a steamy shower is not a cure for croup. Instead, it suggests that if a child has a cold, making them breathe outside air can help. So, steamy showers aren't recommended as a treatment. The article also states that in severe cases, medical intervention is necessary, such as steroids or adrenaline. So, steam isn't a substitute for proper medical care. Additionally, the article advises against using cough suppressants unless the cough persists beyond a week or two. It emphasizes letting the child cough to clear mucus, which is part of the natural healing process. So, putting this together, steam from a shower isn't an effective treatment for croup. The article explicitly says that steamy showers aren't a cure and that other methods, like breathing fresh air, are more appropriate for mild cases. For severe cases, medical attention is required. I should also consider why steam might not be helpful. Croup is viral, so antibiotics aren't effective, and steam doesn't target the virus. It might provide temporary relief by loosening mucus, but it doesn't address the underlying cause. Moreover, hot steam could be dangerous for children, posing a risk of burns. In conclusion, based on the context, steam from a shower doesn't help croup and isn't recommended as a treatment.

It promotes the production of inhibitory neurotransmitters like GABA and glycine, which help in reducing stress and anxiety [32, 33]. Additionally, L-theanine has been shown to increase alpha-wave brain oscillations, which are associated with a relaxed yet attentive state, further contributing to its stress-reducing effects. Studies have demonstrated that L-theanine can decrease the perception of stress and anxiety in individuals, making it a beneficial supplement for those seeking to manage these conditions [42, 43]. Furthermore, when combined with caffeine, L-theanine enhances the cognitive benefits of caffeine while mitigating its potential adverse effects, such as increased anxiety [44, 45, 46, 47].

qid_132,neutral,inhaling steam common cold,Does inhaling steam help treat common cold?,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether inhaling steam helps treat the common cold. I remember that when I had a cold before, my mom used to make me inhale steam from a bowl of hot water. She said it helped with my congestion. But I'm not sure if that's actually effective or if it's just a placebo effect. Let me think about how steam might help. When you inhale warm steam, it probably loosens the mucus in your nose and sinuses. That makes it easier to blow your nose and feel less congested. Maybe it also helps with sore throats because the warm air feels soothing. But I'm not sure if there's any scientific backing to this. I should check some reliable sources. The context provided mentions a Mayo Clinic article on cold remedies. Let me look through that. The article lists several effective remedies, like staying hydrated, resting, using saline nasal drops, and taking pain relievers. It also mentions that adding moisture to the air with a cool mist humidifier can help. However, it specifically advises against using steam because it hasn't been shown to help and may cause burns. Wait, so according to the Mayo Clinic, steam isn't effective and can be dangerous. That's different from what my mom told me. Maybe the difference is between cool mist and warm steam? The article says cool mist is good, but steam isn't. So maybe inhaling steam isn't recommended because it doesn't work and could lead to burns or other injuries. I should also consider other sources. I remember reading somewhere that inhaling essential oils with steam can help, but that's more about the oils than the steam itself. The Mayo Clinic doesn't mention essential oils, so I shouldn't include that unless it's supported by the context. Putting it all together, the Mayo Clinic advises against using steam for treating colds. They recommend cool mist humidifiers instead. So, the answer is that inhaling steam doesn't help and isn't recommended. It's better to use cool mist or other methods mentioned in the article. </think>  Inhaling steam is not an effective method for treating the common cold and is not recommended. According to the Mayo Clinic, steam has not been shown to alleviate cold symptoms and may pose risks such as burns.

qid_137,neutral,vinegar fish bone stuck,Will drinking vinegar dissolve a stuck fish bone?,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether drinking vinegar will dissolve a stuck fish bone. I remember reading somewhere that vinegar is acidic and might help with dissolving things, but I'm not sure if it's effective for something like a fish bone stuck in the throat. First, I should think about what causes a fish bone to get stuck. It's usually because the person didn't chew their food properly or ate too quickly. The bone then lodges in the throat or esophagus, causing discomfort or pain. The context provided mentions that foods like fish bones can get stuck, so that's a good starting point. Now, the question is about using vinegar. Vinegar is acidic, specifically acetic acid. I know that acids can dissolve certain materials, like calcium, which is found in bones. But does that mean it can dissolve a fish bone stuck in the throat? Looking at the context, it says that drinking fluids can help, but it specifically advises against drinking acidic liquids like vinegar. It mentions that while they might seem like they could break up the food, they can irritate the stomach or esophagus. So, according to the context, vinegar isn't recommended because it can cause more harm than good. I should also consider the potential risks. If someone drinks vinegar, it's acidic enough to potentially burn the throat or esophagus, which would make the situation worse. Instead, the context suggests using warm water or tea to help lubricate the esophagus and encourage the food to pass. Additionally, the context provides other methods for dealing with stuck food, such as coughing, using the Heimlich maneuver, or seeking medical help if necessary. It doesn't mention vinegar as a solution, which further supports the idea that it's not advisable. So, putting it all together, drinking vinegar isn't a safe or effective method for dissolving a stuck fish bone. It can cause irritation and is not recommended. Instead, safer methods like drinking warm water or seeking medical assistance should be considered. </think Drinking vinegar is not recommended to dissolve a stuck fish bone. While vinegar is acidic and might seem like it could break down the bone, it can irritate the esophagus or throat, potentially worsening the situation.

qid_139,neutral,copper bracelets reduce pain,Can copper bracelets reduce the pain of arthritis?,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether copper bracelets can reduce the pain of arthritis. I remember reading somewhere that people use these bracelets as an alternative treatment, but I'm not sure if there's any scientific backing to it. Let me try to break this down. First, I should understand what arthritis is. From what I know, arthritis is a condition that causes pain, swelling, and stiffness in the joints. There are different types, like osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis is more about the wear and tear of cartilage, while rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease where the body attacks its own joints. Now, copper bracelets are often marketed as a way to alleviate the symptoms of arthritis. The idea is that copper has some healing properties, maybe through its interaction with the body's chemistry. But does this actually work? I recall reading a study mentioned in the context provided. It was conducted by researchers at York University and involved testing magnetic bracelets, copper bracelets, and non-magnetic steel bracelets on people with osteoarthritis. The study found that there was no significant difference in pain relief between the copper bracelet and the other types. However, the copper bracelet didn't perform worse than the non-magnetic one, which was interesting. Another study looked at rheumatoid arthritis patients and again found no significant difference between the copper bracelet and the control. This suggests that copper bracelets might not have a specific effect on arthritis pain beyond a placebo effect. But wait, some people in the comments mentioned that they experienced relief. For example, one person said their pain went away after wearing a copper bracelet. How does that fit in? It could be that the placebo effect is strong here. If someone believes the bracelet will help, they might actually feel better, even if there's no scientific basis for it. I also remember reading about the placebo effect in the context. It's when a person's expectation of improvement leads to actual improvement, even if the treatment isn't effective. So, if someone expects a copper bracelet to help, they might feel less pain because of that belief. Another point is that copper bracelets are considered safe. Unlike medications, they don't have side effects, so even if they don't work for everyone, they're a low-risk option. However, some people might be allergic to copper, so that's something to consider. I also wonder about the mechanism by which copper bracelets might work. Some theories suggest that copper can be absorbed through the skin and have anti-inflammatory properties. But I don't recall seeing strong evidence supporting this. The studies mentioned didn't find a significant effect, so it's possible that any benefits are more psychological than physical. In summary, while some individuals report pain relief from copper bracelets, scientific studies haven't found consistent evidence that they reduce arthritis pain beyond a placebo effect. However, since they're generally safe, they might be worth trying for those who are interested, but they shouldn't replace conventional medical treatments. </think>  Copper bracelets are often used as an alternative treatment for arthritis, but their effectiveness is not supported by strong scientific evidence. Studies conducted by researchers at York University, including one on osteoarthritis patients and another on rheumatoid arthritis patients, found no significant difference in pain relief between copper bracelets and non-magnetic controls [1, 2]. These findings suggest that any benefits from copper bracelets may be due to the placebo effect, where the belief in the treatment's efficacy leads to perceived improvement [0]. While some individuals report relief, the studies indicate that copper bracelets do not have a specific analgesic effect beyond what might be expected from a placebo. However, copper bracelets are generally considered safe and low-risk, making them a viable option for those interested in trying alternative therapies. It is important to note that they should not replace conventional medical treatments for arthritis. In conclusion, copper bracelets may provide temporary relief for some individuals, but their use should be approached with an understanding that their benefits are not scientifically proven and",unhelpful,neutral_helpful_qid_139_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00866-of-07168.143736.md,['doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00866-of-07168.143736.md'],unhelpful

Athlete's foot ( also know as tinea pedis) is a fungal infection of the skin that causes scaling, flaking, and itch of affected areas, is caused by fungi. It is usually transmitted in moist damp communal areas where people walk barefoot, such as locker rooms, showers or bathhouses, the disease requires a warm moist environment, such as the inside of a shoe, in order to incubate. How Did I Get It? While the fungus is generally picked up through walking barefoot in an infected area or using an infected towel, infection can be prevented by remaining barefoot as this allows the feet to dry properly and removes the fungus' primary incubator - the warm moist interior of a shoe. Athlete's foot can be treated by a number of pharmaceuticals (including creams) and other treatments If untreated, skin blisters and cracks caused by Athlete's foot can cause serious bacterial infections. The treatment of Athlete's foot depends on the type and extent of the fungal infection, so it is important to consult with a podiatrist before choosing a therapy. What Are My Treatment Options?

qid_146,neutral,vitamin d asthma attacks,Can vitamin D supplements improve the management of asthma?,"Okay, so I need to figure out if vitamin D supplements can help manage asthma. I remember reading that vitamin D is important for more than just bone health. It plays a role in the immune system too. The context provided mentions that vitamin D deficiency is common and that it's linked to asthma through various risk factors like living in high latitudes, during winter, industrialization, poor diet, obesity, and dark skin pigmentation [0]. The article also talks about how vitamin D has immunomodulatory effects. It affects T cells and B cells, which are part of the immune response. This could mean that vitamin D might help in reducing asthma symptoms by modulating the immune system. Additionally, the article mentions that vitamin D increases the production of antimicrobial peptides like cathelicidin, which could help in fighting off infections that often trigger asthma attacks [0]. Another point from the context is that vitamin D might influence airway smooth muscle remodeling and function. This is important because asthma involves airway inflammation and constriction. If vitamin D can help reduce this remodeling, it might lead to better asthma management [0]. The article also suggests that vitamin D could modulate the response to standard asthma therapies, such as glucocorticoids and immunotherapy. This means that taking vitamin D supplements might enhance the effectiveness of these treatments, leading to better control of asthma symptoms [0]. However, the context provided is part one of a two-part review, focusing on potential mechanisms. It doesn't provide direct evidence from clinical trials or studies showing the effectiveness of vitamin D supplements in asthma management. So, while the mechanisms suggest a possible benefit, more research, especially clinical studies, would be needed to confirm these findings. In summary, based on the mechanisms outlined in the context, vitamin D supplements might improve asthma management by modulating the immune system, reducing infections, influencing airway structure, and enhancing the response to asthma medications. But further research is necessary to establish the actual benefits and appropriate dosages. </think>  Vitamin D supplements have the potential to improve the management of asthma through several mechanisms. Firstly, vitamin D deficiency is linked to asthma via shared risk factors such as high latitude, winter season, industrialization, poor diet, obesity, and dark skin pigmentation [0].

Additionally, vitamin D increases the production of antimicrobial peptides like cathelicidin, which may help combat infections that often trigger asthma attacks [0]. Furthermore, it may influence airway smooth muscle remodeling and function, potentially reducing airway inflammation and constriction associated with asthma [0]. Vitamin D could also enhance the effectiveness of standard asthma therapies, such as glucocorticoids and immunotherapy, thereby improving symptom control [0]. However, while these mechanisms are promising, the context provided is part of a review focusing on potential mechanisms and does not include direct evidence from clinical trials.
