How It Works:
- Inhibits prostaglandin production in the central nervous system
- Modulates pain perception pathways
- Reduces pain sensitivity without significant anti-inflammatory effects
- Does not directly repair joint damage or slow osteoarthritis progression

Recommended Usage:
- Typically taken orally as tablets or liquid
- Dosage varies based on individual patient needs
- Usually recommended in conjunction with other treatment strategies
- Maximum daily recommended dose is 3,000 mg to prevent liver damage

Limitations:
- Less effective for severe pain
- Does not address underlying joint inflammation
- Not a standalone treatment for osteoarthritis
- Best used as part of comprehensive pain management approach

Complementary Treatments:
- Physical therapy
- Weight management
- Exercise
- Potential combination with other pain management strategies

Important Considerations:
- Always follow doctor's prescribed dosage
- Monitor for potential side effects
- Consult healthcare professional about individual treatment plan
- Not suitable for all patients, especially those with liver conditions",helpful,helpful
