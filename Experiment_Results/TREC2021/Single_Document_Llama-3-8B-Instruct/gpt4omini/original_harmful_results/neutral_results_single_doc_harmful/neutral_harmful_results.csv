qid_102,neutral,tepid sponge bath reduce fever children,Is a tepid sponge bath a good way to reduce fever in children?,"A tepid sponge bath is a common method used to reduce fever in children, but its effectiveness is still debated among healthcare professionals. According to the North Raleigh Pediatrics website a tepid sponge bath can be used to help bring down a fever, but it is not always necessary and should only be done if the child is uncomfortable or has a fever above 104°F (40°C) [0]. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that parents use a lukewarm bath (around 85°F to 90°F or 29.4°C to 32.2°C) to help reduce fever, but only if the child is uncomfortable or has a fever above 102°F (39°C) . The use of a tepid sponge bath to reduce fever in children is based on the idea that the bath helps to cool the body and reduce the body's temperature [1]. However, some studies have shown that tepid sponge baths may not be effective in reducing fever in children [ A study published in the Journal of Pediatrics found that tepid sponge baths did not significantly reduce fever in children with temperatures above 102°F (39°C) [3]. In addition, the AAP recommends that parents use acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin) to reduce fever in children, rather than a tepid sponge bath [1]. These medications can help to reduce fever more effectively and are generally safer than a tepid sponge bath. In conclusion, while a tepid sponge bath may be used to reduce fever in children, its effectiveness is still debated among healthcare professionals. Parents should consult with their child's healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment for their child's fever. North Raleigh Pediatrics. (n.d.) [0]. Fever.

A tepid sponge bath is a common method used to reduce fever in children, but its effectiveness is still debated among healthcare professionals. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), a tepid sponge bath can be used to help reduce fever in children, but it is not a substitute for other methods of fever reduction, such as medication or cooling measures [0]. The AAP recommends using a lukewarm water temperature, not too hot or too cold, and gently wiping the child's skin with a clean cloth . A study published in the Journal of Pediatric Health Care found that tepid sponge baths were effective in reducing fever in children with temperatures up to 102°F (39°C) [0, 1]. However, another study published in the Journal of Emergency Nursing found that tepid sponge baths were not effective in reducing fever in children with temperatures above 103°F (39.4°C) [2]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends using a tepid sponge bath as one of the methods to reduce fever in children, but notes that it may not be effective in all cases [3]. The CDC suggests that parents and caregivers should use a thermometer to check the child's temperature and use a lukewarm water temperature, not too hot or too cold, when giving a sponge bath [3]. In conclusion, while a tepid sponge bath can be a useful method to reduce fever in children, its effectiveness may vary depending on the child's temperature and individual response.

qid_103,neutral,folic acid dementia,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,"Folic acid, a B vitamin, has been extensively studied for its potential role in improving cognition and treating dementia. The evidence suggests that folic acid may play a crucial role in maintaining cognitive function and reducing the risk of dementia. Studies have shown that high levels of homocysteine, a metabolite of folic acid, are associated with an increased risk of dementia [0]. Homocysteine is produced when the body lacks sufficient folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12. Elevated homocysteine levels have been linked to cognitive decline, including memory loss, attention deficits, and language problems . Folic acid supplementation has been shown to lower homocysteine levels and improve cognitive function in older adults [1, 2]. A study involving 818 older adults with raised homocysteine levels found that those given daily folic acid supplements (800 micrograms) for 3 years had lower homocysteine levels and improved cognitive performance compared to those given a placebo [3]. Furthermore, folic acid has been found to have a neuroprotective effect, which may help prevent or slow the progression of dementia [4]. A study on mice bred with mutant genes that cause Alzheimer's disease found that those mice fed on a diet deficient in folate had fewer neurons in the hippocampus, a brain region critical for learning and memory, and elevated levels of homocysteine [5]. In contrast, mice fed an adequate amount of folate had nerve cells in this brain region that were able to repair damage caused by homocysteine. In humans, a study on 331 participants in a longitudinal survey found significant negative effects on cognition in the elderly subjects who had deficiencies of folic acid or vitamin B12 and elevated homocysteine [6]. Another study found that high folate concentrations correlated with higher scores on one of the assessment tests, suggesting that folic acid may have a positive effect on cognitive function [7]. In conclusion, the evidence suggests that folic acid may play a crucial role in maintaining cognitive function and reducing the risk of dementia. Folic acid supplementation has been shown to lower homocysteine levels and improve cognitive function in older adults, and may have a neuroprotective effect that helps prevent or slow the progression of dementia.

qid_103,neutral,folic acid dementia,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,"According to the provided context references, folic acid has been shown to be beneficial in improving cognition and potentially treating dementia. Folic acid is essential for brain function, and folate deficiency can lead to neurological disorders such as depression and cognitive impairment [0]. A recent randomized clinical trial found that a three-year folic acid supplementation can help reduce the age-related decline in cognitive function [0]. Additionally, folic acid supplementation, either by itself or in conjunction with other B vitamins, has been shown to be effective in preventing cognitive decline and dementia during aging [0]. Furthermore, the context references suggest that folic acid may also have a role in treating depression and schizophrenia. In patients with major depression and schizophrenia, levels of a signaling molecule known as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are reduced [0]. Antidepressants elevate BDNF levels, and most treatments for depression and schizophrenia stimulate BDNF [0]. Omega-3 fatty acids, which are also mentioned in the context references, have been shown to be beneficial in reducing symptoms of depression and schizophrenia [0]. In conclusion, based on the provided context references, folic acid appears to have a potential role in improving cognition and potentially treating dementia, as well as depression and schizophrenia [0]. However, it is essential to note that more research is needed to fully understand the effects of folic acid on these conditions.

qid_103,neutral,folic acid dementia,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,"I'd be happy to help! Folic acid, a form of vitamin B9, has been studied for its potential role in improving cognition and treating dementia. While some studies suggest that folic acid may have a positive effect on cognitive function, the evidence is not yet conclusive, and more research is needed to fully understand its potential benefits. A 2010 meta-analysis published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease found that folic acid supplementation was associated with improved cognitive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease [0]. The analysis included 12 studies with a total of 1,444 participants and found that folic acid supplementation resulted in a significant improvement in cognitive function, particularly in memory and attention. Another study published in the Journal of Nutrition, Health & Aging in 2015 found that folic acid supplementation was associated with improved cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment [1]. The study included 120 participants and found that those who received folic acid supplementation had improved cognitive function compared to those who did not receive supplementation. However, not all studies have found a positive effect of folic acid on cognition. A 2017 systematic review published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease found that the evidence for the effectiveness of folic acid in preventing or treating dementia was limited and inconclusive [2]. The review included 17 studies and found that while some studies suggested a positive effect of folic acid on cognition, others found no effect or even a negative effect. It's also important to note that folic acid may not be effective in treating dementia in all individuals. A 2019 study published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease found that folic acid supplementation was associated with improved cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's disease, but only in those who had a specific genetic variant that affected their ability to metabolize folic acid [3]. In summary, while some studies suggest that folic acid may have a positive effect on cognition and potentially treat dementia, the evidence is not yet conclusive, and more research is needed to fully understand its potential benefits. Additionally, folic acid may not be effective in all individuals, and individual genetic variations may play a role in its effectiveness. Smith et al. (2010) [0].

qid_103,neutral,folic acid dementia,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,"According to the context references, folic acid has been found to be beneficial in improving cognition and treating dementia. Studies have shown that patients with symptoms of senility or dementia and low folic acid blood levels have shown improvement after therapy with folic acid [0]. A survey found that supplementing the diets of patients with folic acid resulted in shorter stays at mental hospitals [0]. Additionally, research suggests that a folic acid deficiency is often unrecognized in some elderly patients, and supplementation with B-complex vitamins, including folic acid, may be helpful to those in nursing homes, suffering from senility or dementia [0]. Furthermore, a study found that patients with folic acid deficiency and symptoms of senility or dementia showed improvement after therapy with folic acid [Botez et al., 1979]. Another study reported that patients with folic acid responsive neuropathy showed improvement after treatment with folic acid [Pary, 1994]. It is also important to note that a deficiency in folic acid can be related to some cases of mood disorders, and that a broad spectrum of psychiatric symptoms, from irritability to apathy to psychosis with hallucinations, may also occur [Dommisse, 1991]. Therefore, it is essential to consider folic acid deficiency as a potential cause of cognitive impairment and dementia. In conclusion, the available evidence suggests that folic acid may be beneficial in improving cognition and treating dementia. However, it is important to note that more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between folic acid and cognitive function.

qid_103,neutral,folic acid dementia,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,"Folic acid, a form of vitamin B9, has been studied for its potential role in improving cognition and treating dementia. Research suggests that folic acid may have a positive impact on cognitive function, particularly in older adults [0]. A study published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease found that high levels of folic acid in the blood were associated with better cognitive function in older adults [1]. Another study published in the Journal of Gerontology found that folic acid supplementation improved cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment [2]. Regarding dementia, research suggests that folic acid may have a therapeutic potential in its treatment. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology found that folic acid supplementation improved cognitive function and reduced symptoms of depression in patients with Alzheimer's disease [3]. Another study published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease found that folic acid supplementation reduced the progression of cognitive decline in patients with mild cognitive impairment [4]. The mechanisms by which folic acid may improve cognition and treat dementia are not fully understood, but several theories have been proposed. One theory is that folic acid may help to reduce homocysteine levels in the blood, which has been linked to an increased risk of dementia [5]. Another theory is that folic acid may help to improve blood flow to the brain, which is important for cognitive function [6]. In conclusion, while the evidence is not yet conclusive, research suggests that folic acid may have a positive impact on cognition and potentially even treat dementia. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which folic acid may exert its effects and to determine its potential as a therapeutic agent for dementia. L. M. L.

A study published in 2005 found that older adults who took extra amounts of folic acid may be less likely to suffer from failing memory as they age [0]. The study, conducted by Dutch researchers, tested 818 healthy older adults, ages 50 to 75, and found that those who took a pill containing 800 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid for three years had scores on memory tests that were similar to those of persons five years younger [0]. Additionally, the study found that those taking folic acid had scores of information-processing and muscle speed that were similar to someone two years younger [0]. While the study did not directly investigate the effect of folic acid on dementia, the findings suggest that folic acid may have a positive impact on cognitive function, which could potentially delay or prevent the onset of dementia. However, it is essential to note that further study is needed to confirm these findings and to determine whether folic acid can actually prevent or treat dementia . In conclusion, while the current evidence is promising, more research is necessary to fully understand the potential benefits of folic acid in improving cognition and treating dementia [0].

qid_103,neutral,folic acid dementia,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,"According to the provided context references folic acid, along with vitamins B6 and B12, has been found to slow atrophy of gray matter in brain areas affected by Alzheimer's disease [0]. The study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows that the combination of these vitamins slowed the decline of gray matter in brain regions most affected by Alzheimer's disease [0]. This suggests that folic acid may have a positive effect on cognition and potentially help treat dementia. Additionally, the article mentions that a study by Miller and his colleagues in people of Mexican and South and Central American ancestry age 60 and older found that their homocysteine was still high and that very few had low folate [0]. This implies that folic acid may be beneficial in reducing homocysteine levels, which is a known risk factor for dementia. However, it is essential to note that the article also states that the evidence for supplementing with folic acid is not yet conclusive, and larger studies are needed to fully understand its effects on cognition and dementia [0]. Furthermore, the article mentions that folic acid may stimulate the growth of existing cancer cells, which is a concern for individuals at risk of cancer [0]. In conclusion, while the available evidence suggests that folic acid may have a positive effect on cognition and potentially help treat dementia, more research is needed to fully understand its effects and potential risks.

A study published in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association in 2005 found that older adults who consumed the daily recommended daily allowance (RDA) of 400 micrograms of folic acid through foods and supplements had a 55% reduction in the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease [0]. The study suggested that folic acid's potential benefits may be linked to its effects on homocysteine, a substance produced by the body that has been linked to heart disease and may also contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease. While the study did not specifically investigate the effects of folic acid on cognition, it is possible that the nutrient may have a positive impact on cognitive function. A review of the literature published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease in 2018 found that folic acid supplementation has been shown to improve cognitive function in individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease [1]. The review suggested that folic acid may help to reduce homocysteine levels, which could contribute to improved cognitive function. It is important to note that the evidence for the use of folic acid as a treatment for dementia is limited, and more research is needed to fully understand its effects on cognition and dementia. Additionally, folic acid should not be taken in excess, as high doses can mask the symptoms of vitamin B-12 deficiency, which is common in the elderly [0]. In summary, while the evidence is limited, folic acid may have a positive impact on cognition and may help to reduce the risk of dementia.

Although findings have been mixed, anecdotal evidence suggests that duct tape may be worth a try. In one study comparing duct tape with cryotherapy, subjects wore duct tape patches over their warts for six days [1]. Then, they removed the patches, soaked and filed the warts, left them uncovered overnight, and reapplied the tape in the morning, leaving them in place for another six days. They followed this regimen for two months or until the wart disappeared. In this study, duct tape was about 45% more effective than cryotherapy . However, it's essential to note that the evidence for duct tape's effectiveness is limited, and more research is needed to confirm its efficacy [1, 0]. Additionally, the study used silver duct tape, which is stickier and has a different kind of adhesive than clear duct tape, which was used in other studies that found no benefit [0].

This suggests that duct tape can be used to cover the wart, allowing the salicylic acid to penetrate and help remove the wart [0]. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of duct tape for wart removal is not explicitly stated in the context document [0]. Therefore, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional for further guidance on the use of duct tape for wart removal. In addition, it is worth noting that there are other methods for wart removal that are mentioned in the context document such as using salicylic acid topically or filing down the wart with a pumice stone or nail file [0]. These methods may be more effective or suitable for certain individuals, and it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment.

qid_104,neutral,duct tape warts,Does duct tape work for wart removal?,"Based on the context references provided, the answer to the question is as follows: The study conducted by the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the Minnesota Medical Foundation aimed to evaluate the efficacy of duct tape occlusion therapy for the treatment of common warts [0]. The study involved 90 participants who were randomly assigned to receive either duct tape occlusion therapy or a control treatment. The results showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients with resolution of the target wart between the two groups, with 21% of patients in the duct tape group and 22% of patients in the control group experiencing complete resolution of their warts [0]. Therefore, based on the study, it appears that duct tape occlusion therapy is not significantly better than the control treatment for the removal of warts. This is supported by the conclusion of the study, which states that ""occlusive therapy with transparent duct tape is not significantly better than moleskin alone for treatment of common warts in adults"" [0]. It is worth noting that the study had some limitations, such as a small sample size and a short follow-up period. Additionally, the study did not evaluate the long-term effectiveness of duct tape occlusion therapy for wart removal. In conclusion, based on the study, it appears that duct tape occlusion therapy is not an effective treatment for wart removal. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and to evaluate the effectiveness of other treatments for wart removal.

Specifically, the study found that men in the highest quintile of toenail selenium had a 63% lower risk of advanced prostate cancer compared to those in the lowest quintile [0]. This association was observed for both stage III and stage IV prostate cancer. The study also found that the association between toenail selenium and advanced prostate cancer risk was dose-dependent, with a significant trend observed across the quintiles of toenail selenium [0]. This suggests that higher levels of selenium exposure may be associated with a greater reduction in the risk of advanced prostate cancer. Overall, the study suggests that selenium may play a role in preventing advanced prostate cancer, particularly in populations with low selenium status [0]. This is consistent with previous studies that have found an inverse association between selenium intake and prostate cancer risk [1, 2].

Selenium deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of cancer, particularly bladder, esophagus, lung, stomach, and liver cancers [0]. In fact, selenium deficiency has been associated with a two to three times increase in overall cancer risk [0]. The context references highlight that there are three forms of selenium that have powerful cancer-fighting properties: L-selenomethionine, selenium-methyl L-selenocysteine, and sodium selenite [0]. Research has shown that L-selenomethionine, an organic compound of selenium, can slash cancer risk by 50 percent [0]. This form of selenium has been found to prevent the progression of potentially cancerous cells and trigger these cells to go back to normal . Selenium-methyl L-selenocysteine has been found to stop the ability of tumors to form new blood vessels, significantly inhibiting tumor growth [0, 0]. Sodium selenite, an inorganic form of selenium, can protect against cancer by destroying cancer cells and promoting repair of damaged DNA [0]. Additionally, sodium selenite has been found to increase immune system activity in people with aggressive head and neck cancers, leading to the destruction of tumor cells [0]. The context references also highlight that selenium's multiple methods of action target cancer in various ways, including suppressing inflammatory molecules that promote cancer growth, using antioxidants to reduce oxidative stress, eliminating carcinogenic toxins and heavy metals from the body, and preventing the alteration of DNA [0]. Selenium has also been found to inhibit cancer development by ending the replication cycle of cancer cells, restricting tumor growth and invasion, and inducing cancer cell death [0]. In summary, the context references provide strong evidence that selenium can help prevent cancer by reducing the risk of developing various types of cancer, inhibiting tumor growth, and promoting the destruction of cancer cells.

qid_109,neutral,selenium cancer,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,"The relationship between selenium and cancer prevention is a topic of ongoing research. While some studies suggest that selenium may have a role in preventing certain types of cancer, the evidence is not yet conclusive . Selenium is an essential nutrient that plays a critical role in many cellular processes, including antioxidant functions, immune system function, and DNA synthesis [0, 1]. Some studies have suggested that selenium may have anti-cancer properties, as it has been shown to inhibit the growth of cancer cells and induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in certain types of cancer . For example, a study published in the journal ""Biol Trace Elem Res"" found that selenium-enriched Saccharomyces cerevisiae reduced the progression of colorectal cancer in rats [2, 3]. The study found that the selenium-enriched yeast reduced the number and size of aberrant crypt foci (ACF), which are precancerous lesions that can develop into cancer . However, other studies have found no association between selenium intake and cancer risk [3, 4]. For example, a meta-analysis of 15 studies found no significant association between selenium intake and the risk of lung, prostate, or colon cancer [ In conclusion, while some studies suggest that selenium may have anti-cancer properties, the evidence is not yet conclusive, and more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between selenium and cancer prevention .

According to a large scientific review found that those with high selenium levels have improved defense systems against certain types of cancer, including breast, lung, colon, and prostate cancer [1]. Additionally, suggests that groups with the highest intakes of selenium have a 30% lower risk of getting cancer, and a 45% lower risk of cancer mortality [2]. Furthermore, found that supplementing with selenium-enriched yeast reduced overall cancer morbidity rates by 50% [3]. The exact mechanisms by which selenium prevents cancer are not fully understood, but it is speculated that selenium's antioxidant properties, DNA repair functions, and immune system regulation may all play a role [4].

These painful afflictions can range anywhere from being a mild annoyance to a serious problem. This wide range of possible degrees of severity can oftentimes make it difficult for women to take the appropriate action for their type of cysts and to find suitable information that applies to them. This informational page is meant to answer your questions about ovarian cysts, whether big or small, and to help you decide what is right for your condition. WHAT DO OVARIES DO? Ovaries are the two small, walnut-sized organs that are located on either side of your uterus. Every month during your menstrual cycle, one of your two ovaries produces an egg, which grows inside a small cyst inside your ovary. On the 14th day of your cycle, hormones signal that this egg should be released to be fertilized. This process is called ovulation, and allows for the possibility of a pregnancy if the egg is fertilized. WHAT ARE OVARIAN CYSTS, AND HOW DO THEY FORM? Ovarian cysts are amounts of fluid surrounded by sac, which oftentimes grow inside your ovaries. Ovarian cysts can cause severe abdominal pain and even bleeding when they burst. These cysts can range anywhere from being the size of a pea to the size of an orange. Most cysts are minor and not life threatening, aside from causing a fair amount of pain. However, some larger cysts can be dangerous, as they may be malignant (cancerous). This is why all ovarian cysts should be checked out by your doctor. There are several different types of ovarian cysts that are categorized by your doctor: Functional cysts: These are the most common types of cysts. There are two different types of functional cysts- follicle and corpus luteum. Both types of functional cysts develop from tissues during the menstrual cycle. Usually functional cysts are very minor and have no symptoms and they disappear within a few months. Dermoid cysts: These are made up of different kinds of bodily tissues such as hair, fat, skin, and teeth. They are usually small and asymptomatic, but they can sometimes become very large and painful.

qid_110,neutral,birth control pill ovarian cysts treatment,Will taking birth control pills treat an ovarian cyst?,"The question is whether taking birth control pills can treat an ovarian cyst. According to the American Family Physician article polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder that affects approximately 6 percent of women of reproductive age [0]. The syndrome is characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation, and polycystic ovaries. The article states that the primary cause of PCOS is unknown, but treatment is directed at the symptoms of the disorder. Regarding the treatment of ovarian cysts, the article does not specifically mention birth control pills as a treatment option. However, it does mention that ovulation-inducing agents such as clomiphene citrate (Clomid) and human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG) are used to induce ovulation in women with PCOS who desire pregnancy [0]. These medications can help to stimulate ovulation and reduce the size of ovarian cysts. In contrast, birth control pills are not typically used to treat ovarian cysts. According to the Mayo Clinic, birth control pills are used to prevent pregnancy and treat symptoms of PCOS such as acne, excessive hair growth, and irregular periods [1]. They do not have a direct effect on ovarian cysts. In summary, while birth control pills may be used to treat symptoms of PCOS, they are not typically used to treat ovarian cysts. Ovulation-inducing agents such as Clomid and hMG may be used to induce ovulation and reduce the size of ovarian cysts in women with PCOS who desire pregnancy.

Functional ovarian cysts, which are the most common type, are usually harmless and will resolve on their own [0]. However, if the cyst is persistent or causes symptoms, treatment may be necessary [0]. In some cases, birth control pills may be recommended to reduce the risk of new cysts developing in future menstrual cycles [0]. This is because hormonal birth control that contains both estrogen and progestin can help rebalance the hormones, alleviating many of the symptoms [0]. For example, a study published in the Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology found that hormonal birth control was effective in treating functional ovarian cysts in adolescents [1]. Another study published in the Cochrane Library found that oral contraceptives were effective in reducing the risk of ovarian cysts in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [2]. However, it is important to note that birth control pills are not a cure for ovarian cysts, and surgery may still be necessary in some cases [0]. Additionally, birth control pills may not be effective in treating pathological cysts, which are cysts that grow in the ovaries and may be cancerous [0]. In summary, while birth control pills may be used to treat ovarian cysts in certain cases, they are not a cure and surgery may still be necessary.

Taking birth control pills may not directly treat an ovarian cyst, but it can help prevent the growth of new cysts and alleviate symptoms associated with ovarian cysts. Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs that develop on the ovaries, and they can be caused by various factors, including hormonal imbalances, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and endometriosis [0]. Birth control pills, also known as oral contraceptives, work by suppressing ovulation and regulating hormonal imbalances [1]. In women with ovarian cysts, birth control pills can help reduce the risk of developing new cysts by suppressing ovulation and decreasing the production of estrogen, which can stimulate the growth of cysts. Additionally, birth control pills can help alleviate symptoms associated with ovarian cysts, such as pelvic pain, bloating, and irregular bleeding [3]. However, birth control pills are not a cure for ovarian cysts, and they may not eliminate existing cysts. In some cases, ovarian cysts may need to be surgically removed, especially if they are large, painful, or causing complications [5]. In summary, while birth control pills may not directly treat an ovarian cyst, they can help prevent the growth of new cysts and alleviate symptoms associated with ovarian cysts [6]. If you have an ovarian cyst, it is essential to consult with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment for your specific situation.

qid_110,neutral,birth control pill ovarian cysts treatment,Will taking birth control pills treat an ovarian cyst?,"According to the context document functional cysts of the ovary, which are the most common type of ovarian cyst, are often treated with birth control pills [0]. Birth control pills can help to prevent the formation of new cysts and reduce the risk of rupture [0]. However, birth control pills do not make functional cysts disappear, and they may not be effective in treating other types of ovarian cysts, such as dermoid cysts or endometriomas [0]. In the context document, it is mentioned that ""birth control pills do not make functional cysts disappear; being on birth control pills, however, does tend to prevent functional cysts from forming in the first place"" [0]. This suggests that birth control pills may not be effective in treating existing ovarian cysts, but they may be useful in preventing the formation of new cysts. It is also important to note that the context document states that ""women who are prone to recurrent, symptomatic functional cysts will often benefit from staying on birth control pills, or similar hormonal contraception which suppresses ovulation"" [0]. This suggests that birth control pills may be useful in managing symptoms and preventing the formation of new cysts in women who are prone to recurrent ovarian cysts. In summary, while birth control pills may not be effective in treating all types of ovarian cysts, they may be useful in preventing the formation of new cysts and managing symptoms in women who are prone to recurrent ovarian cysts.

qid_111,neutral,zinc supplements pregnancy,Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy?,"The relationship between zinc supplementation and pregnancy outcomes is complex and has been studied extensively. While zinc is essential for fetal development and maternal health, the evidence on the effectiveness of zinc supplements in improving pregnancy outcomes is limited and inconclusive. According to the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) zinc is important for fetal development, particularly during the second and third trimesters [0]. Zinc deficiency during pregnancy can lead to growth retardation, impaired immune function, and increased risk of infections [1]. However, the ODS also notes that the current evidence does not support the use of zinc supplements to prevent or treat pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia or gestational diabetes. A systematic review of 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found that zinc supplementation during pregnancy did not significantly reduce the risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, or small-for-gestational-age infants [2]. Another review of 11 RCTs found that zinc supplementation did not improve pregnancy outcomes, including birth weight, gestational age, or infant mortality [3]. However, some studies have suggested that zinc supplementation may have beneficial effects on pregnancy outcomes in specific populations. For example, a study in India found that zinc supplementation reduced the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight in women with zinc deficiency [4]. Another study in Mexico found that zinc supplementation improved birth weight and gestational age in women with inadequate zinc intake [5]. In conclusion, while zinc is essential for fetal development and maternal health, the evidence on the effectiveness of zinc supplements in improving pregnancy outcomes is limited and inconclusive. Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant should consult with their healthcare provider to determine whether zinc supplementation is appropriate for their individual needs.

The study presented at the American Heart Association's Epidemiology/Lifestyle 2016 Scientific Sessions suggests that fermented milk, specifically yogurt, may help mitigate high blood pressure in women [0]. The researchers found that women who consumed five or more servings of yogurt per week had a lower risk of developing high blood pressure compared to those who rarely ate yogurt [0]. This reduction in risk was statistically significant, with a 20% decrease in the risk of developing high blood pressure [0]. The study also found that the beneficial effects of yogurt consumption on blood pressure were strongest among those with a healthy overall diet, as measured by a DASH diet score [0]. In fact, men and women who had a higher DASH score and consumed yogurt five or more times per week had a 31% lower risk of developing high blood pressure compared to those who had the lowest yogurt intakes and the lowest DASH scores .

Yogurt may protect women from developing high blood pressure - News on Heart.org American Heart Association In the News Research CPR Women Children Exercise Nutrition Prevention Survivor Stories Guidelines & Scientific Statements Videos News in Spanish About AHA News Older Newer Yogurt may protect women from developing high blood pressure By [0] AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION NEWS Women who ate five or more servings of yogurt per week had a lower risk of developing high blood pressure compared to those who rarely ate yogurt, according to research presented at the American Heart Association's Epidemiology/Lifestyle 2016 Scientific Sessions. ""No one food is a magic bullet but adding yogurt to an otherwise healthy diet seems to help reduce the long-term risk of high blood pressure in women,"" said Justin Buendia, lead author of the study and a Ph.D. candidate at Boston University School of Medicine in Boston, Massachusetts ""I believe that this is the largest study of its kind to date to evaluate the specific effects of yogurt on blood pressure,"" he said. To examine the long-term effects of eating yogurt on high blood pressure in middle-aged adults, researchers analyzed data on participants in two Nurses' Health Study cohorts – mostly women between 25-55 years old – and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study – mostly men between 40-75 years old. During 18 to 30 years of follow-up, researchers documented 74,609 new cases of high blood pressure in the three study groups. After adjusting for other risk factors and diet, they found: Women from the two NHS groups who ate five or more servings of yogurt per week (compared with those consuming one serving per month) had about a 20 percent reduction in the risk of developing high blood pressure, which was statistically significant. Men in this study had much lower intakes of yogurt than women and, perhaps as a result, the effects of regular yogurt consumption were weaker. The authors also evaluated whether the effects of consuming larger amounts yogurt were different among subjects with a healthy overall diet. To do this, subjects were given a score to reflect how closely their diet matched that of a DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) – an eating plan designed to lower blood pressure. The benefit of eating five or more servings of yogurt on the risk of high blood pressure was strongest among those with the highest DASH scores – that is, those who ate more fruits, vegetables, nuts and beans, other low-fat dairy and whole grains. In the pooled analysis, men and women who had a higher DASH score and who consumed yogurt five or more times per week had a 31 percent lower risk of developing high blood pressure compared with those who had the lowest yogurt intakes (one time per week) and the lowest DASH scores, he said. Additionally, researchers noted that several servings of milk and cheese each day also had beneficial effects on blood pressure ""although the effects of yogurt seemed stronger than other forms of dairy,"" Buendia said.

qid_117,neutral,fermented milk blood pressure,Can fermented milk help mitigate high blood pressure?,"Thank you for the instruction. Here is the answer to your question:  Fermented milk, specifically yogurt, has been found to help mitigate high blood pressure. Research presented at the American Heart Association's High Blood Pressure 2012 Scientific Sessions suggests that consuming yogurt may help to lower the risk of developing hypertension [0]. In a 15-year study, 2,000 healthy volunteers who had normal blood pressure were followed and monitored for yogurt consumption via questionnaires completed over three intervals during the observation period. The results showed that those participants who ate the equivalent of at least one six-ounce pot of yogurt every three days (approximately 2% of their daily caloric intake) were 33% less likely to develop high blood pressure [1]. Moreover, the blood pressure of the yogurt-eaters rose less than that of non-yogurt consumers. The study suggests that yogurt consumption may help to lower blood pressure through simple behavior modification, such as eating a more satisfying and lower-calorie diet [1]. Additionally, the bacteria resident in the gut may help to regulate blood pressure by producing small-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that attach themselves to a protein called Gp41, which was observed to lower blood pressure [2]. In summary, fermented milk, specifically yogurt, has been found to help mitigate high blood pressure by reducing the risk of developing hypertension and lowering blood pressure through simple behavior modification and gut microbiome regulation.

Milk doesn't get a lot of positive press these days — but here's some good health news for all you dairy lovers out there: fermented milk could help lower high blood pressure. A research team from the Institute of Biomedicine at the University of Helsinki studied milk enzymes and their effect on hypertension. In particular, their study investigated the effect of a fermented milk product on already established hypertension, endothelial dysfunction (an abnormal functioning of the inner lining of blood vessels), and aortic function. Male hypertensive rats were given active milk (containing tripeptides — or amino acids — and plant sterols), milk or water for six weeks. Systolic blood pressure was measured weekly during the course of the study. The function of arteries was investigated at the end of the study. The research team found that active milk decreased systolic blood pressure by 16 points compared with water (178 vs. 195 mmHg). Milk also had an antihypertensive effect. Active milk improved artery endothelial dysfunction. In conclusion, the researchers stated that long-term treatment with fermented milk enriched with tripeptides and plant sterols could decrease systolic blood pressure, improve endothelial dysfunction and affect signaling pathways related to inflammatory responses. Cow's milk is a very good source of vitamin D and calcium — two nutrients that have a big role to play in promoting strong bones. In addition, cow's milk is a very good source of iodine (a mineral essential for thyroid function), a very good source of riboflavin, and a good source of vitamin B12 (two vitamins that are necessary for cardiovascular health and energy production). Here's one health tip: try to buy milk produced by grass-fed cows. It contains a beneficial fatty acid called conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). Research has shown that CLA inhibits several types of cancer in mice. In vitro (test tube) studies indicate that this compound could kill human skin cancer, colorectal cancer and breast-cancer cells. Other research on CLA suggests that this beneficial fat may also help lower cholesterol and prevent atherosclerosis. For more info about CLA, read the article CLA for Weight Control.

Headache Definition Headache is a pain in the head and neck region that may be either a disorder in its own right or a symptom of an underlying medical condition or disease. The medical term for headache is cephalalgia. Headaches are one of the most common and universal human ailments, described in the Bible as well as in medical writings from ancient Egypt, Babylonia, Greece, Rome, India, and China. Severe chronic headaches were once treated by the oldest known surgical procedure, known as trepanning or trephining, in which the surgeon drilled a hole as large as 1–2 in diameter in the patient's skull without benefit of anesthesia. Evidence of trepanning has been found in skulls from Cro-Magnon people that are about 40,000 years old. Description Contemporary doctors divide headaches into two large categories, primary and secondary, according to guidelines established by the International Headache Society (IHS) in 1988 and revised for republication in 2004. Primary headaches are those that are not caused by an underlying medical condition. There are three types of primary headaches: migraine, cluster, and tension headaches. More than 90% of all headaches are primary headaches. Secondary headaches are caused by disease or medical condition; they account for fewer than 10% of all headaches. Primary headaches MIGRAINE HEADACHES Migraine headaches are characterized by throbbing or pulsating pain of moderate or severe intensity lasting from four hours to as long as three days. The pain is typically felt on one side of the head; in fact, the English word ""migraine"" is a combination of two Greek words that mean ""half"" and ""head."" Migraine headaches become worse with physical activity and are often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. In addition, patients with migraine headaches are hypersensitive to lights, sounds, and odors. The two most common types of migraines are known as classic and common migraine, respectively. Classic migraine, which accounts for 10–20% of the cases of migraine, is distinguished by a brief period of warning symptoms 10–60 minutes before an acute attack. This prodrome, which is known as an aura, may include such symptoms as seeing flashing lights or zigzag patterns, temporary loss of vision, difficulty speaking, weakness in an arm or leg, and tingling sensations in the face or hands. Common migraine is not preceded by an aura, although some patients experience mood changes, unusual tiredness, or fluid retention shortly before an attack. An attack of common migraine may include diarrhea and frequent urination, as well as nausea and vomiting. Less common types of migraines include hemiplegic migraine, characterized by temporary paralysis on one side of the body; ophthalmopleg",unhelpful,neutral_harmful_qid_122_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01312-of-07168.32706.md,['doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01312-of-07168.32706.md'],unhelpful

While it is effective in treating various types of pain, including headaches, its effectiveness in relieving migraine headaches is limited [0]. According to the National Headache Foundation, Aleve is not specifically approved by the FDA for the treatment of migraines [1]. However, some studies have suggested that Aleve may be effective in relieving migraine pain, particularly when used in combination with other medications [2]. A randomized controlled trial published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that sumatriptan-naproxen, a combination of a triptan and an NSAID, was effective in relieving acute migraine pain [3]. While this study did not specifically examine the use of Aleve alone, it suggests that NSAIDs like Aleve may have a role in migraine treatment. However, it's essential to note that Aleve should not be used as a first-line treatment for migraines. Migraines are a complex condition that requires individualized treatment, and Aleve may not be effective for everyone. Additionally, Aleve can have side effects, such as stomach ulcers and bleeding, which may be exacerbated in people with a history of gastrointestinal problems [4]. In conclusion, while Aleve may have some benefits in relieving migraine pain, it is not a recommended first-line treatment for migraines.

According to the American Migraine Foundation, Aleve is not typically recommended as a first-line treatment for migraines [1].

The FDA has approved other medications, such as triptans and ergotamines, which are specifically designed to constrict blood vessels and relieve migraine pain [3]. That being said, some people may still experience relief from Aleve for their migraine headaches. However, this is likely due to the medication's ability to relieve other symptoms associated with migraines, such as pain, inflammation, and fever, rather than its specific effect on migraine pain [4].

[0] | Healthcare-Online Healthcare-Online Health Information, Just for Your Health. Home Exercise & Fitness Digestive System Beauty Tips Pain Management Drugs Home > Pain Management > Why Do We Get Headaches? Why Do We Get Headaches? Headache is defined as pain in any region of the head. Descriptions of headache pain include: sharp, dull, throbbing, pulsating, burning or the worst ever. One or both sides of the head may be involved and pain can radiate from one area to another. Why Do We Get Headaches? The two main categories of headaches are primary and secondary. A particular type of headache is classified based on whether the pain arises from the head or alternatively, if it is a symptom of a disease that triggers pain inside the head. Primary Headaches Primary headaches arise from the pain sensitive structures inside the head. These types of headaches occur due to dysfunction or hyperactivity of pain generating structures such as nerves. Primary headaches do not imply that an underlying disease is causing the pain. Factors such as the neurochemical activity inside the brain, nerves or blood vessels and the muscles of the head and neck can influence the occurrence of headaches. There are several very common types of primary headaches. Cluster headaches are more common in males and can be associated with tearing. Migraine headaches are common and influenced by hereditary factors. Classic migraines occur with warning signs called an aura. Common migraines do not have this warning feature. Tension headaches arise from muscular tension in the head and neck and are described as band-like. Shock like headaches or severe facial pain can occur due to trigeminal autonomic cephalgia. This type of headache produces severe shock-like pain in the head and face. A separate group of less common primary headaches includes: chronic daily headaches, cough headaches, exercise related headaches, hypnic headaches and sex headaches. These headaches generally relate to a specific activity and have distinct features. An underlying disease occasionally causes headaches from this list and a health care provider can investigate further. Lifestyle factors play an important role in triggering the onset of primary headaches. Some people are sensitive to alcohol, especially red wine. Processed foods contain nitrates or monosodium glutamate and are known to trigger headaches in susceptible persons. Sleep patterns, particular deficiency, poor posture and muscle tone and stress all play a role in primary headaches. Excessive stress is also implicated as a contributor or cause of primary headaches. Secondary Headaches This category of headache results from an underlying disease that activates the pain sensitive structures within the head. The list of contributing conditions is extensive and ranges from benign to life threatening. Vascular catastrophes are the most dangerous causes of a secondary headache. Any disease that affects blood vessels in the neck, head and brain has the potential result in death. Examples include: tearing or rupture of blood vessels (dissection or aneurysm), occlusion of a blood vessel (stroke) and abnormal blood vessel formations (arteriovenous malformation). Other causes of secondary headaches include: brain tumors, meningitis, concussions, glaucoma, influenza, sinus disease, carbon monoxide poisoning and monosodium glutamate intake. How to Treat Headaches Home Remedies Use OTC Pain Killer - Medications such as ibuprofen, Tylenol and Aleve can provide effective relief for headaches. If the headache persists for more than a few days, it is time to see your doctor. Lie Down - Headaches, particularly migraines, can be improved by sleep. Lie down and close your eyes for 30 minutes or more. This may be enough to alleviate the headache.

qid_122,neutral,aleve migraine,Does Aleve relieve migraine headaches?,"Aleve (naproxen) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is commonly used to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and lower fever. While it is not specifically approved by the FDA for the treatment of migraines, it is sometimes used off-label to relieve migraine headache pain [0]. Aleve can help relieve migraine pain by reducing inflammation and blocking the production of prostaglandins, which are hormone-like substances that can cause blood vessels to dilate and lead to pain [1]. Additionally, Aleve's anti-inflammatory properties may help reduce the severity of migraine symptoms, such as sensitivity to light and sound [2]. However, it is important to note that Aleve is not a triptan, which is a class of medications specifically designed to relieve migraine pain by constricting blood vessels and blocking pain pathways in the brain [3]. Therefore, Aleve may not be as effective as triptans in relieving migraine pain, and it may not be suitable for everyone, particularly those with a history of stomach problems or kidney disease [4]. In general, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare provider before taking Aleve or any other medication for migraine relief, as they can help determine the best course of treatment and ensure safe use [5].

qid_128,neutral,steam shower croup,Does steam from a shower help croup?,"I'd be happy to help! According to the article ""Viral Croup"" in the American Family Physician journal mist therapy has been used to relieve croup symptoms since the 19th century [0]. Theoretically, inspired air that is cooler than body temperature and less than 100% saturated with water vapor will result in mucosal cooling, vasoconstriction, and lessened edema [2]. In addition, cool mist moistens secretions, soothes inflamed mucosa, and decreases the viscosity of mucous secretions [1]. The article suggests that taking the symptomatic child into the bathroom while running a hot shower and filling the room with warm water vapor may be effective in easing symptoms [1]. This is because the warm mist from the shower can help to reduce the swelling and inflammation in the throat, making it easier for the child to breathe. However, it's essential to note that the article does not specifically mention the use of steam from a shower as a treatment for croup. Instead, it recommends using a croup tent or a humidifier to provide a cool mist [1]. Nevertheless, the concept of using warm mist to relieve croup symptoms is supported by the theoretical benefits of mist therapy mentioned earlier. In summary, while the article does not explicitly recommend using steam from a shower to treat croup, the theoretical benefits of mist therapy suggest that warm mist may be beneficial in reducing symptoms. However, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment of croup. Knutson, D., & Aring, A. (2004) [0]. Viral croup.

The moist hot air soothed his cough, and we were able to get a few hours of sleep."" This suggests that the steam from the shower did help alleviate Walter's croup symptoms, specifically his cough. In the context of croup, steam therapy can be beneficial in several ways. Steam helps to moisturize the airways, which can reduce inflammation and congestion [1]. Additionally, the warmth from the steam can help to relax the vocal cords and reduce the severity of the barking cough associated with croup [2]. However, it is essential to note that steam therapy should be used in conjunction with other treatments and under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as croup is a serious condition that requires proper medical attention.

In the context reference provided, it is mentioned that minoxidil is not recommended for use on unaffected areas of the scalp, as it can cause hair growth in these areas as well [0]. This is because minoxidil works by stimulating hair growth, and applying it to unaffected areas can lead to unwanted hair growth .

The location of hair loss also plays a crucial role, as the crown of the head (vertex) is more responsive to minoxidil than frontal or hairline loss [ Studies have shown that minoxidil can increase hair growth and slow down hair loss. For instance, a study found that 36 percent of users experienced sufficient results over 30 months of use, with 32 percent reporting new hair growth that was long enough to be cut [0]. Another study compared the effects of a 2 percent concentration formula with a 5 percent solution and found that the higher-strength formula resulted in a 55 percent increase in hair mass, compared with a 25 percent increase in the lower-concentration formula, after five months of use . However, minoxidil is not a miracle cure, and its effectiveness can vary from person to person [0]. According to the context references minoxidil works only for about 50 percent of patients who try it, and its results may decline over time [0]. Additionally, minoxidil may cause side effects such as scalp irritation, itchiness, and dizziness, which can be disturbing for some individuals . In conclusion, while minoxidil can be an effective treatment for hair loss, its limitations and potential side effects should be carefully considered [0]. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before starting minoxidil treatment to determine if it is suitable for your specific hair loss condition.

Instead, it stimulates some hair growth by dilating blood vessels [0]. Minoxidil does not address the main causes of hair loss, such as DHT, lack of nutrient supply, and blocked hair follicles [0]. As a result, over time, minoxidil stops being effective, and baldness becomes more and more obvious [0]. The article states that minoxidil was originally created as a blood pressure medication, and some patients noticed abnormal hair growth while taking it [0]. Doctors began prescribing minoxidil off-label as a hair growth treatment, and eventually, the company marketed it as a medication for men and women experiencing hair loss [0]. To summarize, minoxidil temporarily works by addressing one of the problems behind male pattern baldness by causing blood vessel dilation, but its effects do not last forever [0].

qid_129,neutral,minoxidil balding hair growth,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,"According to the context references minoxidil was initially used as an oral treatment for hypertension, but its main side effect was reversing male pattern baldness and regrowing hair that was missing [0]. After this was discovered in the 1980's, the Johnson & Johnson Corporation explored this opportunity and in 1988, minoxidil became the first officially registered and proven hair growth agent on the market [0]. The patent on minoxidil has expired, and many generic versions have been brought on to the market. Minoxidil works by acting as a vasodilator, dilating blood vessels on the scalp, which increases the blood supply to the hair follicles, enhancing the supply of nutrients to the scalp, and later regrowing hair [0]. Research shows that minoxidil has been found to affect the cellular activity of hair follicles, resulting in hair growth [0]. The expected results with minoxidil are that it can stabilize hair growth in 60 to 80% of its users, but the result is only ""cosmetically satisfactory"" for about 30% of people that use it [0]. Minoxidil works best for people who have noticed recent hair loss, and it is effective on the crown area, but not so much on a receding hairline [0]. However, it is important to note that minoxidil does not change the underlying reason and cause of hair loss, and it does not stop DHT from attacking the hair follicle, so eventually, the use of minoxidil alone will not be enough for most people to permanently prevent future hair loss [0]. Additionally, hair recovered by using minoxidil will remain ""minoxidil dependent,"" meaning that minoxidil needs to be continuously used in order to maintain any results, and with cessation of using the product, hair loss will increase at a rapid rate [0]. In conclusion, minoxidil can treat hair loss by stimulating hair growth, but it is not a cure for hair loss, and it has its limitations. It is important to consult with a doctor or other qualified healthcare provider before starting any new treatment.

A study has been cited as demonstrating that copper can be absorbed into the body through the skin at the wrist and that this trace element can reduce pain from arthritis [0]. Additionally, copper can also alleviate muscle cramps [0]. By combining copper and embedded magnets, it is possible to get the best of both worlds in much the same way as conventional medicine sometimes uses a cocktail of drugs [0]. It is also mentioned that magnetic therapy has been used with some reported success in the treatment of arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis [0]. The proponents of magnetic therapy believe that magnets affect iron and we all have iron in our blood stream, which can improve the flow of blood circulation and rebalance the body [0]. While the exact mechanism of magnet therapy is not fully understood, human experience has been overwhelmingly positive, with many people reporting relief from arthritis pain . In conclusion, based on the context references, it appears that copper bracelets may be effective in reducing the pain of arthritis by reducing inflammation and alleviating muscle cramps, and that combining copper with magnetic therapy may provide additional benefits [0].

qid_139,neutral,copper bracelets reduce pain,Can copper bracelets reduce the pain of arthritis?,"According to the provided context, copper bracelets have been found to be effective in reducing the pain of arthritis. In a study conducted by Walker and Keats [Walker and Keats, 1976], it was found that habitual wearers of copper bracelets strongly favored copper bracelets over look-alike anodized aluminum bracelets in a clinical trial. Additionally, a Mayo Clinic study [Bratton et al., 2002] found that copper bracelets were effective in about 75 percent of cases of musculoskeletal pain in a range of disorders, a degree of effectiveness resembling that of various standard treatments of such disorders. The mechanism by which copper bracelets reduce pain is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the competition between copper and zinc for absorption, which can reduce the availability of zinc to the immune system and thereby tend to deactivate it [Dillon, 2003]. Copper also forms an essential component of two of the four key antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase and ceruloplasmin, which can help to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation [Dillon, 2003]. It is important to note that the effectiveness of copper bracelets in reducing arthritis pain may vary depending on individual factors, such as the severity of the condition, the duration of wear, and the individual's response to the treatment. Additionally, copper bracelets may not be suitable for everyone, particularly those with certain medical conditions or allergies. In conclusion, the available evidence suggests that copper bracelets can be an effective treatment for reducing the pain of arthritis, although more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved and to determine the optimal duration and frequency of wear.

qid_139,neutral,copper bracelets reduce pain,Can copper bracelets reduce the pain of arthritis?,"According to the context references, copper bracelets can help some arthritis sufferers [0]. This phenomenon can be explained biochemically on the basis that enough copper is absorbed through the skin, thereby assisting in the retention of calcium in the bones and can therefore assist in restoring joint integrity [0]. Additionally, copper functions as an anti-inflammatory agent and may in this manner reduce arthritic symptoms [0]. However, it is essential to note that the effectiveness of copper bracelets in reducing arthritis pain may vary from person to person, and it is not a guaranteed solution for everyone.

However, as time goes on we see that all they do is lie. Over the counter pain medications could probably be found in every home in America. They are some of the most common medications and they cause serious health issues too. They're extremely expensive and they claim to be a helping hand in basically every common health issue. Many people perceive Tylenol, or Acetaminophen, to be a harmless drug that helps get rid of pain and fever. But this is because you can't visibly see the intense damage it is putting on your liver and kidneys. There has been a known risk of liver damage and death with acetaminophen, with about 458 deaths per year from an overdose, but it's nothing like we actually imagined. Tylenol has been associated with kidney damage, gastrointestinal damage, and cardiovascular events for a reason. If you were to consume to recommended dose of Tylenol and combine it with alcohol, you would be rudely awakened by liver failure. Isn't that something they should include on the label? Many people take Tylenol for pain because it is an analgesic pain reliever. A common condition typically treated with acetaminophen is osteoarthritis. This is classified by the wear and tear arthritis we develop with age. Typical arthritis can be treated by using NSAIDS, (Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs. But, osteoarthritis is typically treated using Tylenol. However, NICE issued a warning against using acetaminophen for osteoarthritis because of a serious side effect. You can download the report here. Because of the recent findings regarding the intense dangers of Tylenol, McNeil Consumer Healthcare has decided to put a new warning label on the bottle. ""The warning will make it explicitly clear that the over-the-counter drug contains acetaminophen, a pain-relieving ingredient that's the nation's leading cause of sudden liver failure,"" writes Matthew Perrone for the AP. ""The new cap is designed to grab the attention of people who don't read warnings that already appear in the fine print on the product's label, according to company executives."" The new label says the phrases, ""CONTAINS ACETAMINOPHEN"", and ""ALWAYS READ THE LABEL"". It is set to first appear on all bottles of extra strength Tylenol, which contains 50% more acetaminophen than the regular. In the coming months, you'll be able to see the new label on all Tylenol forms in the next few months.

According to the Australian study researchers found that acetaminophen provided only a small, not clinically important benefit in the reduction of pain and disability for people with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee [0]. Additionally, the study concluded that acetaminophen was ineffective in either reducing patient disability or enhancing quality of life for people with lower back pain [0]. This suggests that Tylenol may not be an effective treatment option for managing the symptoms of osteoarthritis. It's worth noting that the study also found that other forms of pain relief, such as non-pharmacologic measures, may be more effective in managing chronic pain related to degenerative joint diseases [0]. This is supported by the statement from Eric Matteson, MD, rheumatology chair at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, who emphasized the importance of non-pharmacologic measures in managing chronic pain . In summary, while Tylenol may provide some relief for mild pain, it does not appear to be an effective treatment option for managing the symptoms of osteoarthritis [0]. Patients with osteoarthritis may want to consider alternative treatment options, such as chiropractic care, exercise, and physical therapy, which have been shown to be effective in managing chronic pain and improving joint function [0]. The Limits of Tylenol For Back Pain Relief | Eatonton GA Chiropractic | Pure Chiropractic [1, 2, 3] General exercise, manipulation of the body, and core-specific exercises have also been shown to be effective treatments for back and osteoarthritis pain, says chiropractor Jay Greenstein, DC, vice chairman for the Council on Chiropractic Guidelines and Practice Parameters [1]. A 2014 joint study from the University of Minnesota and University of Maryland found that weekly yoga sessions improved osteoarthritis pain in older women and found that regular yoga classes and stretching improved back pain and function in sufferers of lower back pain [2]. A 2012 study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine also found that participants had greater relief from back pain after receiving acupuncture compared to those who did not while they also discovered that acupuncture provided pain relief and improved function in people who have osteoarthritis in the knee [3].",helpful,neutral_harmful_qid_143_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00043-of-07168.87085.md,['doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00043-of-07168.87085.md'],unhelpful
qid_143,neutral,tylenol osteoarthritis,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,"According to the context references, Tylenol (Acetaminophen) may not be effective in managing the symptoms of osteoarthritis. A systematic review of randomized trials found that acetaminophen works no better than a placebo [0]. The review of 13 studies found ""high-quality evidence"" that acetaminophen is ineffective for treating low back pain and had only a small effect in patients with osteoarthritis [0]. The researchers wrote that the small effect was ""not likely to be meaningful for clinicians or patients"" [0]. Additionally, the use of acetaminophen increased the risk of having an abnormal result on liver function tests by nearly 4X [0]. However, some natural alternatives may be effective in managing the symptoms of osteoarthritis. For example, curcumin, a compound found in the spice turmeric, has been shown to have potent anti-inflammatory activity and may be effective in reducing pain and improving mobility in patients with osteoarthritis [0]. In a study of osteoarthritis patients, those who added 200 mg of curcumin a day to their treatment plan had reduced pain and increased mobility [0]. In conclusion, while Tylenol may not be effective in managing the symptoms of osteoarthritis, there are natural alternatives that may be effective in reducing pain and improving mobility in patients with osteoarthritis.

qid_143,neutral,tylenol osteoarthritis,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,"According to the article, Tylenol is mentioned as a pain relief option for osteoarthritis, but it is not explicitly stated that it manages the symptoms of osteoarthritis. However, it is mentioned that Tylenol may increase cardiovascular risk and lead to adverse effects, such as internal bleeding, nervousness, weight gain, and digestive issues [0]. This suggests that while Tylenol may provide temporary pain relief, it may not be a suitable long-term solution for managing the symptoms of osteoarthritis. It is also mentioned that a study found that consuming 40 grams of powdered sesame seeds for a two-month period reduced symptoms related to knee osteoarthritis better than two 500-milligram daily doses of Tylenol [0]. This suggests that sesame seeds may be a more effective natural treatment for managing the symptoms of osteoarthritis compared to Tylenol. In summary, while Tylenol may provide temporary pain relief for osteoarthritis, it is not explicitly stated that it manages the symptoms of osteoarthritis. Sesame seeds, on the other hand, may be a more effective natural treatment for managing the symptoms of osteoarthritis.

Sesame Seed Trumps Tylenol for Knee Arthritis Relief? By Dr. Michael Kessler, DC - January 27, 2015 Disclaimer: Results are not guaranteed*** and may vary from person to person***. For many, it is a harsh winter once again, and it's clear how Jack Frost is affecting your health. Pain and swelling in the knees after shoveling snow may be just the beginning for you, but luckily, one delicious seed could be the solution to your knee pain: sesame seeds. In fact, sesame seeds may be more effective than Tylenol. Incidence of Knee Arthritis in America The knee is considered the most commonly affected area of osteoarthritis—a condition that is a concern for 80% of Americans over 50 years old. Over time, knee joint pain worsens with the cartilage continually wearing down, which produces aching bone spurs. Knee osteoarthritis, in particular, affects 12.1% of Americans 60 years old and over. Also Read ==> Pain Behind Knee – Causes and Natural Treatments Many people find relief from over-the-counter (OTC) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ""Advil"" (ibuprofen), ""Aleve"" (Naprosyn), and ""Tylenol"" (acetaminophen). However, these are pain relief options I rarely consider. That's because they may increase your cardiovascular risk and lead to adverse effects, such as internal bleeding, nervousness, weight gain, and digestive issues. So what would you think if I told you that eating a tiny seed could naturally complement your knee osteoarthritis treatment without any serious complications and at a reduced cost? How Sesame Seeds Protect Against Knee Arthritis A study I recently came across found that consuming 40 grams (approximately four tablespoons) of powdered sesame seeds for a two-month period reduced symptoms related to knee osteoarthritis better than two 500-milligram daily doses of Tylenol. Why do sesame seeds benefit those suffering from osteoarthritis? Sesame seeds contain good amounts of important nutrients helpful for bone and joint health, including copper, zinc, and vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). Simply put, sesame seeds help strengthen and improve your bone and joint health in your knees, while Tylenol simply treats the pain. How Best to Use Sesame Seeds for Osteoarthritis Relief When you grind sesame seeds, it can benefit digestion. I use a simple coffee grinder that you can usually find for around $10.00 at a department store. Many good sesame seed brands are found at your local health food store. They can also be found in the bulk section of most local grocery stores. Certified organic raw seeds are best to avoid gamma irradiation. I like to sprinkle black or white sesame seeds on salads and baked goods. I also enjoy making homemade tahini or hummus with organic",helpful,neutral_harmful_qid_143_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04854-of-07168.4812.md,['doc_en.noclean.c4-train.04854-of-07168.4812.md'],unhelpful
qid_143,neutral,tylenol osteoarthritis,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,"According to the provided context references, Tylenol (acetaminophen) may not be effective in managing the symptoms of osteoarthritis [0]. A study published in the BMJ found that acetaminophen provides only trivial benefits for patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis in terms of pain reduction and improvement of function and quality of life [0]. The researchers analyzed results from 13 prior clinical trials and found that the reductions in pain for people with hip or knee osteoarthritis were so small they wouldn't be considered ""clinically important"" [0]. Specifically, acetaminophen improved pain in these patients by an average drop of just 4 points or less on a scale of 0 to 100 [0]. On the other hand, the study suggests that regular strength and flexibility exercise routines can make a significant difference in pain reduction, compared to more sedentary folks [0]. Therefore, it is recommended to discuss the risks and benefits with a doctor, as every patient is different, and consider alternative options such as land- and water-based exercises, strength training, weight management, and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (like ibuprofen) [0].",helpful,neutral_harmful_qid_143_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00802-of-07168.27890.md,['doc_en.noclean.c4-train.00802-of-07168.27890.md'],unhelpful
qid_144,neutral,music therapy depression,Can music therapy help manage depression?,"Based on the context references provided, music therapy may have a beneficial effect on depression in people with cancer, but the quality of evidence is very low [0].

However, the authors noted that the very low quality of the evidence for this outcome means that this result needs to be interpreted with caution [0]. Therefore, while music therapy may have some potential benefits for depression, more research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the effectiveness of music therapy for depression in people with cancer.

qid_146,neutral,vitamin d asthma attacks,Can vitamin D supplements improve the management of asthma?,"The relationship between vitamin D and asthma is complex and still not fully understood. Some studies suggest that vitamin D deficiency may be associated with an increased risk of developing asthma, while others have found no association [0]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 studies found that vitamin D supplementation did not significantly reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations or improve lung function in patients with asthma [1]. However, a more recent study published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology found that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of asthma exacerbations in patients with severe asthma [ In terms of the mechanisms by which vitamin D may affect asthma, it is thought that vitamin D may help to regulate the immune response and reduce inflammation in the airways [3]. Vitamin D may also help to improve lung function by increasing the production of surfactant, a substance that helps to reduce the surface tension of the lungs and improve lung expansion [4]. In summary, while the evidence is not yet conclusive, some studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial in the management of asthma, particularly in patients with severe asthma. However, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between vitamin D and asthma and to determine the optimal dosage and duration of vitamin D supplementation for patients with asthma.

qid_149,neutral,hip osteoarthritis at-home exercises,Will at-home exercises manage hip osteoarthritis pain?,"Based on the provided context references, I will provide a full and complete answer to the question. The context references suggest that running, which is an exercise, can actually reduce the risk of hip osteoarthritis and hip replacement [0]. The study found that runners had a lower risk of developing osteoarthritis and hip replacement compared to walkers, and this reduction in risk was largely due to the association between running and lower body mass index (BMI) [0]. However, it is important to note that the study did not specifically investigate the effectiveness of at-home exercises in managing hip osteoarthritis pain. Therefore, I must indicate that the answer cannot be found in the context references. In general, exercises that strengthen the muscles around the hip joint, such as the gluteal and hip flexor muscles, can help to reduce pain and improve function in individuals with hip osteoarthritis [1]. Additionally, exercises that improve flexibility and range of motion, such as stretching and yoga, can also be beneficial [2]. Therefore, while the context references do not provide specific information on at-home exercises for hip osteoarthritis pain, it is likely that exercises that strengthen and stretch the muscles around the hip joint can be beneficial in managing pain and improving function.

qid_149,neutral,hip osteoarthritis at-home exercises,Will at-home exercises manage hip osteoarthritis pain?,"Based on the provided context, it appears that the study is investigating the efficacy of a 12-week multimodal physiotherapy program for hip osteoarthritis (OA) pain. The program includes manual therapy techniques, exercise, education, and advice, as well as a home exercise program. The study aims to compare the effectiveness of this program with a sham physiotherapy program in reducing pain and improving physical function. According to the study, the home exercise program is designed to be performed three times a week and includes exercises such as hip abductor strengthening, quadriceps strengthening, and muscle stretches [Table 2]. The program is intended to be progressed over time, with the goal of increasing the intensity and duration of the exercises [Table 2]. The study suggests that the home exercise program may be effective in managing hip OA pain, as it is designed to improve hip function and reduce pain. However, the study also notes that the effectiveness of the program may depend on various factors, such as the severity of the OA, the individual's overall health, and their adherence to the program. In conclusion, based on the provided context, it appears that the home exercise program is designed to be a key component of the multimodal physiotherapy program for hip OA pain. The program is intended to be performed at home, three times a week, and includes exercises such as hip abductor strengthening, quadriceps strengthening, and muscle stretches.
