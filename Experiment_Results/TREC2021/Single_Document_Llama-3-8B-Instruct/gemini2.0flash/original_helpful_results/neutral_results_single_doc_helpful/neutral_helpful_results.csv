The document states, ""While some parents use lukewarm sponge baths to lower fever, there is no proof that this really works. In fact, sponge baths can make children uncomfortable."" [1, p. 2] [0] This suggests that there is no scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of tepid sponge baths in reducing fever in children, and it may even cause discomfort to the child.  Additionally, the document advises against using cold or icy baths, stating, ""Never give your child an icy or cold bath or alcohol rubs."" [1, p. 3] [0] This implies that any type of bath, including tepid ones, should be avoided in favor of other methods to reduce fever. Instead, the document recommends using medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) to ease a fever, as well as encouraging the child to drink clear fluids such as water with ice chips and Pedialyte (electrolyte oral replacement solution) to prevent dehydration. [1, p. 3] [0] In conclusion, based on the context reference a tepid sponge bath is not a recommended method to reduce fever in children [0]. Instead, parents should consider using medications and encouraging fluid intake to manage fever and prevent dehydration.

In fact, the article suggests that physical measures such as tepid sponging are unnecessary and unpleasant interventions for the child [0]. The authors recommend that antipyretics, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, are the best way to reduce fever and relieve discomfort in children [0]. Additionally, the article states that alternating antipyretics is not supported by evidence and can be confusing for caregivers, potentially leading to incorrect dosing [0]. Therefore, it is recommended to use antipyretics as directed and not to rely on physical measures such as tepid sponge baths to reduce fever in children. References: El-Radhi, A. S., & Barry, W.

qid_102,neutral,tepid sponge bath reduce fever children,Is a tepid sponge bath a good way to reduce fever in children?,"A tepid sponge bath can be a helpful way to reduce fever in children, but it is not always the most effective method [0]. Tepid sponge baths can help to lower the body temperature by increasing blood flow to the skin and promoting sweating [1]. However, it is important to note that a tepid sponge bath should not be used as the sole method of reducing fever, especially in children under three months of age [2]. In these cases, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately . In children over three months of age, a tepid sponge bath can be used in conjunction with other methods, such as administering medication or using a fan to cool the child [3, 4]. It is important to use lukewarm water and to avoid using cold water, as this can cause the child to shiver and actually increase the body temperature [5]. Additionally, it is important to avoid using a tepid sponge bath if the child is vomiting or has a seizure disorder, as this can increase the risk of complications [6]. In summary, a tepid sponge bath can be a helpful way to reduce fever in children, but it should be used in conjunction with other methods and under the guidance of a healthcare professional. It is also important to follow proper technique and precautions to avoid any potential complications. American Academy of Pediatrics [0]. Fever in children. Pediatrics, 142(3), e20182134.

qid_103,neutral,folic acid dementia,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,"The article discusses the relationship between folic acid and Alzheimer's disease [0]. According to the study, folic acid, along with other B vitamins, may help reduce the loss of grey matter in certain regions of the brain, which are vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease. However, the study does not explicitly state that folic acid can improve cognition or treat dementia. The study found that participants who received B vitamins, including folic acid, had less shrinkage of certain areas of grey matter compared to those who received a placebo [0]. However, the study did not assess the effects of folic acid on cognitive function or dementia. It is important to note that the study's findings are based on a secondary analysis of data collected in a previous study, which found that B vitamins reduce whole volume brain shrinkage [0]. The study's conclusions are limited to the specific population studied, and it is unclear whether the results can be generalized to other populations. In summary, while the study suggests that folic acid may be beneficial in reducing grey matter loss in certain regions of the brain, it does not provide conclusive evidence that folic acid can improve cognition or treat dementia.

qid_103,neutral,folic acid dementia,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,"Folic acid, a form of vitamin B9, has been studied for its potential role in improving cognition and treating dementia. While the evidence is not yet conclusive, several studies suggest that folic acid may have a positive impact on cognitive function and dementia risk. A review published in the journal Nutrients in 2016 found that adequate levels of folate, including folic acid, are essential for optimal physiological and neurological functioning [0]. The review highlighted the importance of folate in one-carbon metabolism, which is critical for the synthesis of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, and the maintenance of healthy brain function. Studies have shown that folic acid supplementation may improve cognitive function in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease. A study published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease in 2013 found that folic acid supplementation improved cognitive function in individuals with MCI, particularly in the areas of attention and memory [1]. Another study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology in 2015 found that folic acid supplementation improved cognitive function in individuals with Alzheimer's disease, particularly in the areas of attention and processing speed [ Folic acid has also been shown to have a neuroprotective effect, which may help to prevent or slow the progression of dementia. A study published in the journal Neurology in 2012 found that high levels of folate in the blood were associated with a lower risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease [3]. Another study published in the journal PLOS ONE in 2017 found that folic acid supplementation reduced the risk of dementia and cognitive decline in older adults [4]. While the evidence is promising, it is important to note that more research is needed to fully understand the effects of folic acid on cognition and dementia. Additionally, folic acid supplementation should only be done under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as high levels of folic acid can mask vitamin B12 deficiency and other health problems. In summary, while the evidence is not yet conclusive, folic acid may have a positive impact on cognitive function and dementia risk. Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of folic acid on cognition and dementia, and folic acid supplementation should only be done under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

qid_103,neutral,folic acid dementia,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,"Folic acid, a B vitamin, has been studied for its potential to improve cognition and treat dementia. While some studies suggest that folic acid supplementation may have a positive effect on cognitive function and dementia, the evidence is not yet conclusive. A 2012 meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials found that folic acid supplementation, alone or in combination with other B vitamins, was associated with a significant improvement in cognitive function in older adults [0]. However, a 2014 systematic review of 17 randomized controlled trials found that the evidence for the effect of folic acid on cognitive function was limited and inconsistent [1]. Regarding dementia, a 2014 meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials found that folic acid supplementation, alone or in combination with other B vitamins, was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of dementia [2]. However, a 2017 systematic review of 23 randomized controlled trials found that the evidence for the effect of folic acid on dementia was limited and inconsistent [3]. It is important to note that the majority of these studies were conducted in older adults, and the results may not be generalizable to other populations. Additionally, the optimal dosage and duration of folic acid supplementation for cognitive function and dementia are not yet established. In summary, while some studies suggest that folic acid may have a positive effect on cognitive function and dementia, the evidence is not yet conclusive, and more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of folic acid supplementation for these conditions.

The study, a parallel group, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, involved 59 eligible subjects with moderate to severe asthma who remained symptomatic on moderate to high doses of inhaled steroids. The results showed that the practice of Sahaja yoga improved airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and some aspects of impairment of asthma quality of life (AQLQ) and mood in patients with asthma. Specifically, the study found that the improvement in AHR at the end of treatment was 1.5 doubling doses greater in the yoga intervention group than in the control group (p=0.047) [0]. Additionally, the yoga group had greater beneficial changes in POMS tension and fatigue scales and in the summary mood measure than the control group [0]. The study suggests that the beneficial effects of yoga may be due to an effect on the flow of ""vital energy"" according to the traditional yogic system or an effect on airway smooth muscle dynamics [0]. While the exact mechanism is not fully understood, the study provides evidence that yoga may be a useful adjunctive treatment for patients with asthma who remain symptomatic despite treatment with moderate to high doses of inhaled steroids. In conclusion, the study suggests that yoga may improve the management of asthma by reducing symptoms, improving quality of life, and improving airway hyperresponsiveness.

Research suggests that yoga can help alleviate asthma symptoms, reduce the frequency and severity of asthma attacks, and improve lung function [0]. A study published in the Journal of Asthma found that yoga significantly improved lung function and reduced symptoms in patients with asthma [1]. Another study published in the European Respiratory Journal found that yoga reduced the frequency and severity of asthma attacks in patients with mild to moderate asthma [ Yoga can help manage asthma by reducing stress and anxiety, which are common triggers for asthma attacks [2]. Yoga can also help improve breathing techniques, which can help patients with asthma breathe more efficiently and effectively [3]. Additionally, yoga can help improve overall physical fitness, which can also help manage asthma symptoms [4]. It is important to note that while yoga can be beneficial for managing asthma, it should not be used as a replacement for conventional medical treatment.

The results showed that yoga significantly improved pulmonary function, reduced exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and improved quality of life in patients with mild or moderate asthma. Specifically, the study found that yoga improved forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), and forced vital capacity (FVC) [Table 3]. Additionally, yoga reduced the degree of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in both exercise-sensitive and exercise-resistant subjects [Table 4]. Furthermore, yoga improved asthma quality of life scores, particularly in the symptoms and activity limitation domains [Table 6]. The study also found that yoga reduced the frequency of rescue medication use and improved the overall quality of life scores, with a significant improvement in the total AQOL score and all its sub-domains [Table 6]. The number-needed-to-treat (NNT) for the total AQOL score was 1.82, indicating that one patient would need to be treated with yoga to achieve a clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life [Table 6]. In conclusion, the study suggests that yoga is an effective adjunctive therapy for the management of bronchial asthma, improving pulmonary function, reducing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and improving quality of life.

qid_107,neutral,yoga asthma,Does yoga improve the management of asthma?,"Yes, yoga has been found to improve the management of asthma. Various studies have demonstrated that yoga can help alleviate symptoms of asthma, such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. Yoga has been shown to decrease the frequency and severity of asthma attacks and improve lung function. Additionally, yoga has been found to reduce the need for medication and hospitalization in patients with asthma. The mechanisms by which yoga improves asthma management are not fully understood, but it is thought that yoga may help to reduce stress and anxiety, which are common triggers for asthma attacks. Yoga may also help to improve lung function by increasing oxygenation and reducing inflammation. Furthermore, yoga may help to improve overall health and well-being, which can also contribute to better asthma management. Several studies have investigated the effects of yoga on asthma management in specific populations. For example, a study published in the British Medical Journal found that yoga was effective in reducing symptoms of asthma in patients with chronic severe airway obstruction. Another study published in the Journal of Asthma found that yoga breathing exercises (pranayama) improved airway reactivity in subjects with asthma. In conclusion, the evidence suggests that yoga can be a useful adjunctive therapy for managing asthma. While more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which yoga improves asthma management, the available evidence suggests that yoga may be a valuable tool for reducing symptoms and improving quality of life in patients with asthma.

Most colds are caused by rhinoviruses carried in invisible droplets in the air or on things we touch. These viruses can get into the protective lining of the nose and throat, setting off an immune system reaction that can cause a sore throat, headache, and trouble breathing through the nose. Dry air — indoors or outside — can lower resistance to infection by the viruses that cause colds. So can being a smoker or being around someone who smokes. Smokers are more likely to catch a cold than people who don't smoke, and their symptoms probably will be worse and last longer, and can even lead to bronchitis or pneumonia. But despite some old wives' tales, not wearing a jacket or sweater when it's chilly, sitting or sleeping in a draft, and going outside while your hair's wet do not cause colds. What Are the Signs and Symptoms of a Cold? The first symptoms of a cold are often a tickle in the throat, a runny or stuffy nose, and sneezing. Kids with colds also might feel very tired and have a sore throat, cough, headache, mild fever, muscle aches, and loss of appetite. Mucus from the nose may become thick yellow or green. Are Colds Contagious? Colds are the most common infectious disease in the United States. They're very contagious, especially in the first 2 to 4 days after symptoms begin. They can even spread for a couple of weeks after someone starts feeling sick. Colds spread through person-to-person contact or by breathing in virus particles, which can travel up to 12 feet through the air when someone with a cold coughs or sneezes. Touching the mouth or nose after touching a contaminated surface can also spread a cold. How Long Do Colds Last? Cold symptoms usually appear 2 or 3 days after exposure to a source of infection. Most colds clear up within 1 week, but some last a bit longer. How Are Colds Diagnosed? Your doctor won't be able to identify the specific virus causing cold symptoms, but can examine your child's throat and ears and take a throat culture to make sure the symptoms aren't from another condition that may need treatment. If symptoms get worse instead of better after 3 days or so, the problem could be strep throat, sinusitis, pneumonia, or bronchitis, especially if your son or daughter smokes. If symptoms last for more than a week, appear at the same time every year, or happen when your child is around pollen, dust, or animals, an allergy could be to blame. Kids who have trouble breathing or wheeze when they catch a cold could have asthma. How Are Colds Treated? Colds will clear up on their own without specific medical treatment. Medicine can't cure a cold, but can ease symptoms like muscle aches, headache, and fever.

qid_109,neutral,selenium cancer,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,"Based on the provided context references, the answer to the question is that there is no evidence to suggest that increasing selenium intake through diet or supplementation prevents cancer in humans. The Cochrane review on Selenium for preventing cancer found that well-designed and well-conducted randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown no beneficial effect of selenium supplements in reducing cancer risk [0, 0]. In fact, some RCTs have raised concerns by reporting a higher incidence of high-grade prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes in participants with selenium supplementation [0]. The review also included observational longitudinal studies, which showed an inverse association between selenium exposure and risk of some cancer types, but null and direct relations have also been reported, and no systematic pattern suggesting dose-response relations has emerged [0]. These studies suffer from limitations inherent to the observational design, including exposure misclassification and unmeasured confounding . Therefore, the current evidence does not support the hypothesis that increasing selenium intake may reduce cancer risk [0, 0]. However, more research is needed to assess whether selenium may modify the risk of cancer in individuals with a specific genetic background or nutritional status, and to investigate possible differential effects of various forms of selenium [0].

qid_109,neutral,selenium cancer,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,"Thank you for the instruction. Based on the context references, I will provide a full and complete answer to your question. According to the article ""No Clear Role for Selenium in Cancer Prevention"" some studies have suggested that people with higher selenium levels have a lower risk of certain types of cancer [0]. However, a review conducted by the Cochrane Collaboration found no clear evidence that selenium supplements provide a cancer benefit [1]. The article states that selenium is a trace mineral that is important for human health, and small amounts are generally sufficient, while excess selenium may be harmful [0]. It also mentions that selenium may be taken as a supplement, and some studies have suggested that selenium—an antioxidant—may reduce the risk of certain types of cancer, such as prostate cancer and bladder cancer [0]. However, the article concludes that the available evidence does not support the use of selenium supplements for cancer prevention. The researchers evaluated 55 studies that involved a total of more than one million participants and found that selenium supplements did not reduce the risk of prostate cancer or non-melanoma skin cancer [1]. The researchers concluded that ""Currently, there is no convincing evidence that individuals, particularly those who are adequately nourished, will benefit from selenium supplementation with regard to their cancer risk"" [1]. In summary, based on the available evidence, there is no clear role for selenium in cancer prevention. While selenium may have some benefits, the available evidence does not support the use of selenium supplements for cancer prevention.

qid_110,neutral,birth control pill ovarian cysts treatment,Will taking birth control pills treat an ovarian cyst?,"Based on the provided context references, it can be inferred that taking birth control pills may not be the best solution for treating ovarian cysts. According to the text, ""Women tend to be estrogen dominant today, which means they have excessive estrogen for normal functioning. This results in problems, like endometriosis, PCOS, ovarian cysts and fibroids—not to mention breast, ovarian and uterine cancers."" This suggests that ovarian cysts are often caused by hormonal imbalances, particularly estrogen dominance [0]. The text also states that ""Taking birth control pills to treat hormonal problems is not the answer—it only creates more problems later."" This implies that birth control pills may not be an effective or safe solution for treating ovarian cysts, as it may only mask the symptoms and create further complications [0]. Furthermore, the text suggests that ""There are safer alternatives than hormones"" for treating reproductive health issues, including ovarian cysts [0]. This implies that natural medicine and other non-hormonal approaches may be more effective and safer options for treating ovarian cysts. In conclusion, while the text does not explicitly state that taking birth control pills will not treat ovarian cysts, it suggests that hormonal imbalances, particularly estrogen dominance, are often the underlying cause of ovarian cysts, and that birth control pills may not be an effective or safe solution for treating them. Instead, natural medicine and other non-hormonal approaches may be more effective and safer options.

qid_110,neutral,birth control pill ovarian cysts treatment,Will taking birth control pills treat an ovarian cyst?,"Birth control pills (BCPs) are not a recommended treatment for ovarian cysts. According to Dr. Jeffrey Dach, ""BCPs are a chemical form of castration, which prevent ovulation. Lack of ovulation is the primary defect in PCOS, so birth control pills merely perpetuate the primary defect"" [0]. In fact, BCPs may even worsen the underlying insulin resistance and metabolic problems associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [1]. Instead, treatment for ovarian cysts typically involves monitoring the cysts with ultrasound and hormonal tests to determine if they are benign or malignant. If the cysts are benign, they may not require treatment, as they often resolve on their own [2]. However, if the cysts are causing symptoms or are at risk of twisting or rupturing, surgical removal may be necessary [3]. In some cases, hormonal therapy with progesterone may be used to help regulate ovulation and reduce the size of the cysts. Progesterone therapy has been shown to be effective in treating PCOS-related symptoms, including anovulation and irregular menstrual cycles [4]. However, this treatment approach is typically used in conjunction with other therapies, such as lifestyle changes and medication, rather than as a standalone treatment for ovarian cysts. In summary, birth control pills are not a recommended treatment for ovarian cysts, and treatment typically involves monitoring and managing the cysts with ultrasound and hormonal tests, as well as addressing any underlying hormonal imbalances with progesterone therapy.

In fact, BCPs are considered a chemical form of castration, which may perpetuate the underlying problem rather than solving it [0]. The primary defect in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is anovulation, which is not addressed by BCPs [1]. Moreover, BCPs may worsen insulin resistance and diabetes, which are common comorbidities with PCOS [2]. Instead, the recommended treatment for PCOS and ovarian cysts is natural progesterone therapy. Progesterone is the hormone made by the ovary after an egg is released, and its absence leads to an imbalance in the ovary, causing the stimulation of higher male hormones and irregular periods [3]. Replacing progesterone with natural progesterone cream can help restore normal ovulation and balance the hormonal system [4]. In addition, other treatments such as metformin, spironolactone, and corticosteroids may be used to address specific symptoms and comorbidities associated with PCOS [5].

However, they cannot remove the existing cyst [0]. Therefore, taking birth control pills will not treat an ovarian cyst. It is essential to note that birth control pills are not a solution for removing existing cysts, but rather a method to prevent new cysts from forming [0]. For effective treatment, surgical cyst removal or holistic treatments that address the root causes of the cysts are recommended [0]. Cyst Treatment: Which is the BEST option? [0] Cyst Treatment: Which Is The BEST option? When women discover that they are suffering from the ovarian cyst syndrome, the cysts have usually been there awhile. It was a medical examination that was prompted by irregular periods, pain, weight gain, deepened voice and body hair growth or other symptoms led to the discovery. A cyst can look pretty unnerving. It can appear like a tiny person made of thick fluid, sometimes with hair, and even teeth. It's usually a benign, non-cancerous tumor - but still a tumor, requiring close watch and professional cyst treatment. Natural PCOS treatment at home is an option - hot water bottle and hot baths to relieve the vaginal cramps, also mint, raspberry or chamomile teas can keep the muscles relaxed. Making sure the bladder is emptied as soon as one feels the need to ""go"" also helps. But the fact is, none of this removes the cyst though, which could rupture or cause a complicated ovarian cyst . Birth control pills can prevent ovulation, and therefore, new cysts; but they can't remove the one that's there. Surgical cyst removal is most popular - it's fast and looks safe. Before surgery, many tests are needed to ensure blood pressure and sugar levels are okay for surgery, and treatment given, as needed, to control cardiac problems and fix any existing disease. With all these precautions, surgery may happen safely and without complication, but there's one thing it can't guarantee. It cannot prevent new cysts from forming again. Natural remedy for ovarian cysts is a non-invasive option, also promising cyst removal, but not a cyst-free future. For that it must be a holistic treatment that can ensure that the root causes are completely removed, and once achieved, it never comes back again.

According to the American Academy of Dermatology, there are various treatment options to minimize the appearance of scars, but applying vitamin E cream is not one of them [0]. The academy recommends a consultation between the patient and a dermatologist to decide the best treatment, which may include dermabrasion, surgical scar revision, laser resurfacing, soft tissue fillers, punch grafts, or chemical peels [0]. Vitamin E cream is not mentioned as a treatment option for scar removal in the provided context references. In fact, the article does not mention vitamin E cream as a treatment option for scars at all. It only lists the above-mentioned treatment options, which are recommended by the American Academy of Dermatology [0].

However, there is limited scientific evidence to support the use of vitamin E cream as a treatment for skin scars . In fact, a study published in the Journal of Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery found that vitamin E oil did not improve the appearance of hypertrophic scars [0, 1]. Another study published in the Journal of Dermatology found that vitamin E cream did not show significant improvement in the appearance of acne scars .

qid_114,neutral,vitamin e cream for skin scars,Can applying vitamin E cream remove skin scars?,"According to the provided context references, there is limited evidence to support the claim that applying vitamin E cream can remove skin scars. While some studies suggest that vitamin E may help speed up the healing process and reduce the appearance of scars others have found that applying vitamin E to post-surgical scars does not reduce the size, shape, or color of scars and can even cause allergic reactions or irritation [0, 1]. Additionally, the American Academy of Dermatology states that ""no scar can ever be completely removed"" suggesting that scars are a natural part of the healing process and cannot be fully eliminated [2]. In terms of the effectiveness of vitamin E cream in removing skin scars, the available evidence is mixed. Some studies have found that vitamin E cream can help improve the appearance of scars by reducing redness and inflammation while others have found no significant difference in scar appearance between vitamin E-treated and untreated scars [3, 4]. In conclusion, while vitamin E cream may have some benefits in terms of promoting wound healing and reducing scar appearance, there is limited evidence to support its effectiveness in removing skin scars.

It is a human monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines, which are believed to play a key role in the pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis [7, 8]. Dupixent has been shown to significantly improve symptoms of atopic dermatitis, including itching, inflammation, and skin lesions, in clinical trials [4, 5]. The most common adverse events associated with Dupixent treatment include injection site reactions, eye and eyelid inflammation, and cold sores [9]. In the LIBERTY AD clinical trial program, Dupixent met the primary and key secondary endpoints in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who were inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or immunosuppressants [1]. The results of these studies demonstrated that Dupixent can provide significant improvements in symptoms, quality of life, and skin clearance in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis [ It is important to note that Dupixent is not approved for use in children with atopic dermatitis, and its safety and efficacy in this population have not been fully evaluated [9]. Additionally, Dupixent is not a cure for atopic dermatitis, and it may not work for everyone [3].

qid_118,neutral,dupixent eczema,Can dupixent treat eczema?,"Yes, dupixent (dupilumab) is approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe eczema (atopic dermatitis) whose disease is not well-controlled with topical therapies or when those therapies are not advisable [0]. Dupixent is a human monoclonal antibody designed to specifically inhibit overactive signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, which are believed to be major drivers of the persistent underlying inflammation in AD [0]. The safety and efficacy of Dupixent were established in three placebo-controlled clinical trials with a total of 2,119 adult participants [0]. Overall, participants who received Dupixent achieved greater response, defined as clear or almost clear skin, and experienced a reduction in itch after 16 weeks of treatment [0]. Dupixent can cause side effects, such as serious allergic reactions and eye problems, such as pink eye (conjunctivitis) and inflammation of the cornea (keratitis) [0]. The most common side effects include injection site reactions; cold sores in the mouth or on the lips; and eye and eyelid inflammation, including redness, swelling, and itching [0]. According to Dr. Jonathan Silverberg, Dupixent ""really will be a major improvement and addition to our armamentarium"" for the treatment of eczema [1]. Therefore, Dupixent is a treatment option for adults with moderate to severe eczema who have not responded to other treatments or have concerns about the use of topical corticosteroids. ### References: Therapeutics Update: Notable Approvals in 2017 - Practical Dermatology.

According to the Cochrane review sumatriptan is an abortive medication for migraine attacks, belonging to the triptan family [0]. It is available as a nasal spray, and this route of administration may be preferable for individuals experiencing nausea and/or vomiting [0]. The review found that a single intranasal dose of sumatriptan was effective in relieving migraine headache pain and associated symptoms of nausea, sensitivity to light, and sensitivity to sound [0]. Specifically, pain was reduced from moderate or severe to no pain by two hours in approximately 2 in 10 people (24%) taking sumatriptan 10 mg, compared with about 1 in 10 (10%) taking placebo [0]. Additionally, the 20 mg dose had greater efficacy, but may be associated with more adverse events, most of which were of short duration and mild or moderate in severity [0].

While it is effective as an anti-inflammatory agent for arthritis, sprains, sunburns, and other inflammation-based pain, it is not as effective on headaches [0]. In fact, the text states that Naproxen is ""not as effective on headaches"" and that it is ""especially effective as an anti-inflammatory agent for arthritis, sprains, sunburns, and other inflammation-based pain"" [0]. This suggests that Aleve may not be the best choice for migraine headache relief. However, it's worth noting that the text does not explicitly state that Aleve does not relieve migraine headaches. It only suggests that it may not be as effective as other options. Therefore, it's possible that Aleve may still provide some relief for migraine headaches, although the extent of that relief is not specified. In any case, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional before taking any medication, including Aleve, to determine the best course of treatment for your specific condition.

According to the Cochrane review naproxen was more effective than placebo for relieving migraine headache in adults, but only weakly so [0]. At two hours, about 2 in 10 people (17%) were pain-free when treated with naproxen, compared to about 1 in 10 (8%) when treated with placebo [0]. However, the review also notes that naproxen is not as good as some other medicines, such as ibuprofen or sumatriptan, and that it is not clinically useful as a stand-alone analgesic in acute migraine [0]. Additionally, the review found that naproxen was associated with more adverse events, such as dizziness, tingling sensations, sleepiness, nausea, indigestion, dry mouth, and abdominal discomfort, particularly at the 825 mg dose [0]. Therefore, while Aleve (naproxen) may provide some relief for migraine headaches, it is not a particularly effective or recommended treatment option.",unhelpful,neutral_helpful_qid_122_doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01005-of-07168.135381.md,['doc_en.noclean.c4-train.01005-of-07168.135381.md'],unhelpful
qid_122,neutral,aleve migraine,Does Aleve relieve migraine headaches?,"According to the context references, Aleve (naproxen) is an NSAID that works in the same way as ibuprofen and carries the same risks [0]. While it can reduce the symptoms of tension headache, it is not considered clinically useful for migraine treatment when used alone [0]. However, when combined with sumatriptan, it provides more relief than either sumatriptan or naproxen alone, and you may be able to take a lower dose of sumatriptan if you use naproxen along with it [0]. This can help you avoid the side effects of sumatriptan and can help prevent refractory migraines [0]. Therefore, Aleve can relieve migraine headaches, but only when used in combination with sumatriptan. References: OTC Medications for Migraine and Headache Relief, Verywell Health, April 04, 2019 [0].

qid_122,neutral,aleve migraine,Does Aleve relieve migraine headaches?,"Thank you for the instruction. I will provide a full and complete answer to your question. According to the context reference Aleve is mentioned as a pain reliever, but it does not cure what causes the pain [0]. The text states, ""Does Tylenol or Advil or Aleve really cure what causes your headache or backache or nagging pain of choice? The truth is, it does not. It only tells your brain not to care or notice that pain."" This implies that Aleve, like other pain relievers, only masks the symptoms of migraine headaches, rather than addressing the underlying cause [0]. Therefore, it is unlikely that Aleve would provide long-term relief from migraine headaches. In fact, the text suggests that using pain relievers like Aleve can even exacerbate the problem, stating, ""While we think the Advil is relieving the pain, in fact it is allowing us to do further damage and not feel the pain that would be shouting at us to stop, make adjustments and heal."" For long-term relief from migraine headaches, the text recommends chiropractic care, stating, ""Chiropractic Care can help without the use of pain killers, for a long term relief."" [0] In conclusion, while Aleve may provide temporary relief from migraine headaches, it is unlikely to address the underlying cause of the condition and may even worsen the problem over time [0]. Chiropractic care, on the other hand, may offer a more effective and sustainable solution for managing migraine headaches. Ranicki Chiropractic Wellness Center. (2013, September 19) [0]. Pain Relief.

According to health visitor Penny Lazell, ""Cough medicines and decongestants won't help, nor will a steamy bathroom or humidifiers"" [0]. This is because croup is a respiratory condition where the airways, especially the upper part (including the voice box and windpipe), become inflamed [0]. Steam from a shower may not be able to penetrate deep enough into the airways to provide relief from the inflammation. However, it's essential to note that some healthcare professionals may recommend using a humidifier or taking a warm bath to help relieve congestion and discomfort associated with croup [1]. But, as mentioned earlier, steam from a shower is not a recommended treatment for croup.

While some pediatricians recommend using steamy bathrooms to alleviate symptoms, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that high humidity did not improve symptoms for children with croup [0]. In fact, the study warned that inhaled moisture can aggravate coughing in children who are wheezing [0]. The researchers also noted that popular humidifiers or home shower steam may not create the appropriately sized water particles to reach the toddler's inflamed voice box [0]. Therefore, it is unclear whether steam from a shower is an effective treatment for croup. However, some pediatricians suggest that the comfort of being cradled by a parent in a dark, warm room could alleviate symptoms, regardless of the humidity [0]. Additionally, pediatrician Ed Pont recommends using cold night air to relax the airway, and sucking on a Popsicle to reduce the cough [0]. Therefore, while steam from a shower may not be a proven treatment for croup, other remedies such as cold night air and sucking on a Popsicle may be effective in alleviating symptoms. In conclusion, the effectiveness of steam from a shower in treating croup is uncertain and may not be a recommended treatment.

Based on the context references provided, I will give a full and complete answer to your question. According to the context references, steam inhalation is not recommended for children with croup [0]. In fact, it is explicitly stated that ""DO NOT use steam inhalation – it doesn't help and increases the risk of an accidental burn"" [0]. This is because steam inhalation does not provide any benefits in relieving the symptoms of croup, and it can even pose a risk of accidental burns. Therefore, based on the available context references, it is not recommended to use steam from a shower to help croup. Instead, parents can follow the recommended treatment options, such as giving paracetamol to relieve pain and lower fever, encouraging fluid intake, and seeking medical help if the child's condition worsens . Croup HealthInfo Canterbury Home> [0, 0] Child health > Croup Important Phone 111 for an ambulance if a child with croup: has noisy breathing with both in and out breaths has difficulty speaking is struggling to breath is turning blue or grey is very distressed. Croup is an infection of the upper airway. It is usually caused by a virus that makes the voice box (larynx) swell, which blocks the windpipe (trachea). It is more common in young children, under the age of 3. Croup is not usually serious, and you can usually safely treat it at home. But if your child is having difficulty breathing, take them to a doctor straight away. How do I know if my child has croup? The symptoms of croup can last for three to five days. They include: a loud, barking cough that's often worse at night a high-pitched whistling sound when breathing in fast breathing distress, anxiety, and agitation pale or blue skin a high temperature a hoarse voice. How can I help a child with croup? Make sure you stay calm and reassure your child. Having croup can be scary, but agitation or crying makes it worse. Sit your child upright – this makes it easier for them to breath. Give them paracetamol (Pamol) to relieve any pain and lower their temperature if they have a fever. Follow the instructions on the packet for how much to give. Encourage your child to drink plenty of fluids. This can help to soothe their throat, as well as keeping them hydrated. Avoid any sudden changes in temperature. DO NOT use steam inhalation – it doesn't help and increases the risk of an accidental burn. Steroids (corticosteroids) are used in severe croup to help prevent any breathing problems. They are anti-inflammatories and help reduce any swelling in your child's airways. If your child has had a bad night with croup, or is still having problems during the day, talk to your GP about whether steroids would help.

qid_128,neutral,steam shower croup,Does steam from a shower help croup?,"I'd be happy to help! Croup is a common respiratory illness in children, characterized by a barking cough, hoarseness, and stridor (a high-pitched sound when breathing in). While there is no cure for croup, treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and reducing the severity of the illness. Regarding your question, ""Does steam from a shower help croup?"" The answer is a bit complex. Some studies suggest that steam inhalation, including steam from a shower, may help relieve symptoms of croup, such as congestion and coughing [0]. Steam inhalation can help loosen mucus and reduce inflammation in the airways, making it easier for children to breathe. However, other studies have found that steam inhalation may not be effective in reducing the severity of croup symptoms or shortening the duration of the illness [1]. Additionally, some experts caution that steam inhalation may not be suitable for all children with croup, particularly those with severe symptoms or underlying respiratory conditions [2]. In general, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children with croup be treated with a single dose of oral dexamethasone, a corticosteroid medication, to reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms [3]. Nebulized epinephrine may also be used to help relieve severe symptoms, such as stridor [4]. In summary, while steam from a shower may potentially help relieve some symptoms of croup, such as congestion and coughing, its effectiveness in reducing the severity of the illness is unclear. Children with croup should be treated under the guidance of a healthcare provider, who may recommend a combination of medications and other therapies to manage their symptoms.

qid_129,neutral,minoxidil balding hair growth,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,"According to the context references, minoxidil is a hair growth stimulant approved by the Food and Drug Association (FDA) [0]. It was initially used as an antihypertensive drug but was later used to treat hair loss due to its adverse effect of hypertrichosis, a condition characterized by excessive hair growth [0]. Minoxidil speeds up hair growth and increases hair follicles, resulting in thicker hair [0]. In some cases, it can also slow down hair loss . To make this treatment more effective, it is recommended to apply one milliliter of Minoxidil to the dry scalp at least twice a day and massage it thoroughly [0, 0]. Additionally, a study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Pyrrolidinyl Diaminopyrimidine Oxide Oxothiazolidine Carboxylic acid, a minoxidil analog, along with 5% solution of Minoxidil [1]. The results showed that Pyrrolidinyl Diaminopyrimidine Oxide Oxothiazolidine Carboxylic acid was therapeutically more superior to Minoxidil, with increased mRNA value (13.50%) for SHH gene, which is related to hair growth [1]. The percentage improvement of hair growth increased from baseline to month 2, month 4, and month 5 as 25, 50, and 66%, respectively [1]. In conclusion, minoxidil is a hair growth stimulant that can treat hair loss by speeding up hair growth, increasing hair follicles, and slowing down hair loss. It is recommended to apply Minoxidil to the scalp at least twice a day and massage it thoroughly for optimal results.

qid_129,neutral,minoxidil balding hair growth,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,"Yes, minoxidil has been shown to be effective in treating hair loss, particularly in the context of hair transplantation surgery. According to several studies have examined the use of minoxidil as an adjunct to hair transplantation surgery in men with androgenetic alopecia [0]. For example, Kassimir conducted an uncontrolled study in 12 male patients with androgenetic alopecia, where minoxidil 3% topical solution was administered twice daily to the transplant area starting 48 to 72 hours after hair transplant surgery [3, 6]. The study found that two patients demonstrated hair growth without the usual shedding 2–4 weeks post-surgery, and two additional patients had regrowth within 4 weeks after postsurgical telogen effluvium [0]. Another study conducted by Bouhanna [11, 17] found that in 71% of grafts, partial or total hair was still growing without usual shedding that occurs 2 to 4 weeks postsurgery, when minoxidil 2% was given for 4 weeks prior to surgery, interrupted for 3 weeks, then restarted and continued for 3 months postsurgery [0]. Additionally, Roenigk and Berman reported the effectiveness of administering minoxidil prior to hair transplant surgery in a double-blind trial, where 12 males with androgenetic alopecia were randomized to have either minoxidil 2% topical solution or placebo applied to donor area for 6 weeks prior to transplantation and to recipient areas for 17 weeks after surgery [5, 8]. The study found that significantly less grafted hair was lost by minoxidil-treated patients (22%) compared with placebo-treated patients (22% vs 52%; P=0.001) [ Overall, the studies suggest that minoxidil may speed regrowth in transplanted follicles, prolong the anagen phase, and slow progression of future hair loss [0]. However, it is important to note that controlled clinical trials are needed to substantiate these preliminary data and what impact other factors such as patient education and compliance may have in enhancing hair transplant outcomes [0]. In addition, users of the forum have reported positive experiences with using minoxidil after hair transplant surgery, with some noting that it helped jumpstart the growth of transplanted hairs [1, 2]. However, it is important to note that individual results may vary, and more research is needed to fully understand the effects of minoxidil on hair loss. In conclusion, minoxidil has been shown to be effective in treating hair loss, particularly in the context of hair transplantation surgery. However, more research is needed to fully understand its effects and to determine the optimal dosage and duration of treatment.

qid_129,neutral,minoxidil balding hair growth,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,"Yes, minoxidil can treat hair loss. According to Minoxidil is a reliable option that has helped thousands of people to reverse hair loss [0]. It is a medication that can be acquired as a cream, foam or tablet, and when applied to the skin or ingested, Minoxidil heals and revitalises the skin cells that house hair follicles, prompting the genesis of new, healthy strands of hair [0]. The effects of Minoxidil take a couple of months, but with regular application and a great skincare routine, many report seeing immediate benefits – hair regenerates as thick and strong as ever [0]. Minoxidil is suggested to be a vasodilator, which means that it opens up the tiny blood vessels in the skin on the scalp, thereby allowing more vital nutrients and oxygen to get to areas with poor blood flow [0]. This treatment can effectively be used in severe cases of hair loss [0]. Minoxidil is an established treatment that is prescribed globally to treat hair loss, regulated by the FDA, and can be used at all stages of the treatment process [0]. It is used in conjunction with a number of other treatments in order to maximise the growth potential of your hair; it is crucial because of its ability to help cells get the resources they need to begin growing again [0]. Lastly, it is known to have a small and manageable side effect profile that rarely becomes a problem [0]. In conclusion, minoxidil is a proven treatment for hair loss, and it can be used to stimulate hair growth, improve hair density, and promote a healthy scalp. It is a flexible tool in the arsenal to combat hair loss, and it can be used in conjunction with other treatments to maximize the growth potential of your hair. According to over 500,000 people around the world have had their lives changed by Advanced Hair Studio's treatments, including minoxidil [0]. Therefore, it is recommended to consult with a professional, such as Advanced Hair Studio, to determine if minoxidil is the right treatment for your hair loss. Advanced Hair Studio.

Σχετικές έρευνες 7.5 months treatment with alfatradiol increased the proportion of frontal anagen hair statistically significantly, in women from 69 % to 77 % (means) and in men from 56 % to 65 % Abstract Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), also referred to as male pattern baldness, is the most common cause of hair loss in both sexes in adulthood. An option for topical treatment that selectively targets the metabolic pathways involved in the balding process is alfatradiol, an estrasterid without hormonal activity. In a drug monitoring study, efficacy and safety of alfatradiol (0.025 %) was assessed in 233 patients with AGA (192 women, aged 14 - 76 years, and 41 men, aged 17 - 56 years). After 7.5 months of treatment, trichograms of 112 patients (92 women, 20 men) were evaluated. Under treatment with alfatradiol the proportion of frontal anagen hair increased statistically significantly, in women from 69 % to 77 % (means) and in men from 56 % to 65 %. The proportion of telogen hair decreased accordingly. In 12 % of women and 21 % of men a further decline in the number of anagen hair was observed. Merely three patients (1,3 %) reported mild local adverse reactions. In conclusion, Alfatradiol appears to be effective and safe in the topical treatment of AGA in both men and women. Comparison of the efficacy and safety of topical minoxidil and topical alfatradiol in the treatment of androgenetic alopecia in women. RESULTS: Topical treatment with 2% minoxidil solution for 6 months resulted in a significant increase of cumulative hair thickness (p < 0.0001) and absolute hair density (p < or = 0.0025), whereas these parameters of hair growth remained nearly unchanged after 6 months of treatment with alfatradiol solution. Evaluation of the same parameters from month 7 to month 12 demonstrated that 12 months minoxidil treatment resulted in an increasing stabilization (group I). After the alfatradiol-->minoxidil switch in group II a significant increase in cumulative hair thickness (p < 0.0001) and absolute hair density (p < 0.0001) was achieved. Both study medications were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with minoxidil can induce an increase in hair density and hair thickness,whereas treatment with alfatradiol results in deceleration or stabilization of hair loss.

qid_129,neutral,minoxidil balding hair growth,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,"Thank you for the instruction. Based on the context references provided, I will give a full and complete answer to your question. Minoxidil is an over-the-counter medication for hair loss that is FDA approved [0]. It is often found under the brand names of Rogaine or Theroxidil [0]. Minoxidil is promoted to hair growth by expanding the blood vessels and potassium channels, which allows hair follicles to receive more nutrients and oxygen in the blood [0]. However, Minoxidil has not been shown to effectively or meaningfully restore hair loss from a receding hairline back to a full head of hair on its own [0]. Some people may notice less hair loss after using Minoxidil, and their male pattern baldness may appear to slow down and appear less severe [0]. However, the effects of Minoxidil are apparent only so long as you continue to use it, and it can take four to six months to see any improvement . In summary, while Minoxidil may help slow down hair loss and promote hair growth, it is not a solution for regrowing a receding hairline [0].

qid_129,neutral,minoxidil balding hair growth,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,"According to the context references, minoxidil, also known as Rogaine, is a popular hair loss treatment that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [0]. It is available over-the-counter (OTC) as a liquid or foam to treat male and female pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia) [0]. The active ingredient, minoxidil, is believed to work by partially enlarging hair follicles and elongating the growth phase of hair [ . Rogaine has been shown to be effective in regrowing hair in some people, with clinical studies demonstrating that 40% of men had moderate to dense hair growth on the crown of their head [0]. In a one-year observational study, 62% of the 984 men using 5% minoxidil reported a reduction in hair loss [0]. However, it is essential to note that Rogaine only works in people with a hereditary form of hair loss at the top and back of the scalp [0]. Only about 60% of people in clinical studies had good results, so there is a chance it may not work for everyone [0]. Additionally, Rogaine is not meant for a receding hairline or baldness at the front of the scalp [0]. In conclusion, minoxidil (Rogaine) can treat hair loss, but it is crucial to understand its limitations and potential side effects. It is essential to consult a doctor before using Rogaine, especially if you have a family history of hair loss, sudden hair loss, or other medical conditions . Does Rogaine Work?

qid_129,neutral,minoxidil balding hair growth,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,"Minoxidil is a topical solution that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia, also known as male pattern baldness [0]. It is available over-the-counter (OTC) and is often used in combination with other treatments, such as finasteride, to promote hair growth and slow down hair loss . Minoxidil works by increasing blood flow to the scalp, which helps to stimulate hair growth and slow down hair loss [1, 2]. It also helps to prolong the anagen phase of hair growth, which is the active growth phase of hair [3]. This can lead to thicker, fuller hair and a reduction in hair loss [4]. Studies have shown that minoxidil is effective in treating hair loss, with one study showing that men who used 5% minoxidil solution had a 55% increase in hair regrowth compared to those who used 2% minoxidil solution [5]. Another study found that minoxidil was effective in treating female pattern hair loss, with 80% of women experiencing an increase in hair density [6]. However, it's important to note that minoxidil may not work for everyone, and it's not a cure for hair loss. It's also important to use minoxidil as directed and to be patient, as it may take several months to see results [7]. In conclusion, minoxidil is a effective treatment for hair loss, and it can be used to promote hair growth and slow down hair loss. However, it's important to use it as directed and to be patient, as it may take several months to see results. ""Minoxidil: A Review of Its Use in the Treatment of Androgenetic Alopecia.""

qid_131,neutral,l-theanine supplements anxiety,Can l-theanine supplements reduce stress and anxiety?,"According to the provided context references, l-theanine supplements have been shown to reduce stress and anxiety levels. Research studies have demonstrated that l-theanine works in about 30 minutes, causing the brain to switch over to alpha-type brain waves, which is similar to the state achieved through meditation [0]. This amino acid is involved in the production of the neurotransmitter GABA, which affects other neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine, inducing a relaxed mental state [0]. A review of various natural supplements and herbs, including valerian, passionflower, lemon balm, hops, and skullcap, found that many of these substances have anxiolytic effects and can reduce stress and anxiety symptoms in both animal and human studies [0]. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 60 patients with schizophrenia found that an eight-week course of l-theanine significantly reduced anxiety symptoms, with patients receiving a daily dose of 400 mg . Theanine has been shown to be safe to use and is approved for use in Japan as a food additive [0]. The FDA has set an arbitrary maximum dose of 1,200 mg daily, and studies have used doses ranging from 50 to 200 mg, with benefits appearing in about 30 minutes [0]. In conclusion, l-theanine supplements have been found to reduce stress and anxiety levels by promoting relaxation and inducing a calm mental state. The available research suggests that l-theanine is a safe and effective natural remedy for anxiety, and it can be used in combination with other natural remedies to enhance its benefits.

L-theanine is an amino acid found in green tea that has been traditionally used in Japan to promote relaxation and reduce stress [0]. Studies have consistently demonstrated that l-theanine supplementation can decrease symptoms of anxiety and stress in both healthy individuals and those with anxiety disorders [1, 2]. One study published in the Journal of Functional Foods found that l-theanine supplementation significantly reduced symptoms of anxiety and stress in healthy individuals, with a reduction of 27.5% in anxiety symptoms and 23.1% in stress symptoms [3]. Another study published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found that l-theanine supplementation reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder, with a reduction of 34.6% in anxiety symptoms and 24.5% in depression symptoms [4]. The mechanisms by which l-theanine reduces stress and anxiety are not fully understood, but it is thought to work by increasing the production of GABA, a neurotransmitter that has a calming effect on the brain [ L-theanine may also interact with other neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, to produce a relaxing effect [6].

A more comprehensive approach would involve incorporating a variety of iron-rich foods into the diet, as well as considering supplements or medical treatment if necessary.

The study included 30 patients who were randomly assigned to wear either a copper bracelet or a placebo bracelet for 12 weeks. The results showed that the copper bracelet group had a significant reduction in pain compared to the placebo group. A review of the literature published in the Journal of Pain Research found that the evidence for the effectiveness of copper bracelets in reducing pain is limited and inconclusive [2]. The review included 15 studies that examined the effects of copper bracelets on pain in patients with various conditions, including arthritis. The results showed that while some studies found significant benefits, others found no benefits or even negative effects.

From the community pool to the gym locker room, fungus is everywhere. Unfortunately, no matter how many precautions we take, we may still end up dealing with a nasty bout of athlete's foot. This annoying infection can cause some unpleasant symptoms for your feet, including a burning, itching rash. If you are suffering from athlete's foot then it's time to find out what options you have for eliminating it, and when to see your Oxnard podiatrist Dr. Steven M. Vines for care. Fungal Cream You don't want to just treat the symptoms of your athlete's foot; you want to kill the fungus responsible for your infection, too. The only way to eliminate the fungus is to treat it with an over-the-counter anti-fungal cream or medication like Lotrimin. Apply this cream in between your toes and the bottoms of your feet for several weeks, as directed. It can take anywhere from one to four weeks for your athlete's foot to go away. If you aren't noticing a change in your symptoms after a few weeks, call your Oxnard family podiatrist. Limit sweating This might sound like an odd request, and might be more difficult during the summer months, but fungus thrives on heat and moisture, so it's important to keep your feet dry. Of course, if you are a physically active individual this may be challenging. Use antifungal powder on your feet daily to wick away moisture, and bring an extra pair of clean socks to your next workout so you can change them when you're done. Let your feet breathe If you're dealing with athlete's foot, ease your symptoms by airing your feet out whenever you can. This means opting for sandals and other open-toed shoes that are easier on your healing feet. Of course, this isn't as easy to do during the winter months, but in milder conditions you'll want to opt for more breathable shoes. Wear shoes Fungus is everywhere, particularly locker rooms, community pools, gyms and hotel showers. If you frequent any of these places be sure to always wear shoes or sandals to protect feet from future infections. If over-the-counter remedies just aren't eliminating your symptoms, call your Oxnard foot doctor today. We would be happy to prescribe a stronger medication that can more effectively attack your fungal infection head-on. Call us today to schedule your appointment.

The fungus that causes athlete's foot thrives in damp, moist environments and often grows in warm, humid climates, such as locker rooms, showers and public pools; hence the name ""athlete's foot. "" This infection can itch and burn causing the skin on your feet and between your toes to crack and peel. Tips For avoiding Athlete's Foot: Keep your feet dry, allowing them to air out as much as possible Wear socks that draw moisture away from your feet and change them frequently if you perspire heavily Wear light, well-ventilated shoes Alternate pairs of shoes, allowing time for your shoes to dry each day Always wear waterproof shoes in public areas, such as pools, locker rooms, or communal showers Never borrow shoes due to the risk of spreading a fungal infection Treatment A mild case of athlete's foot will generally clear up on its own with over-the-counter antifungal creams and sprays.

Generally, it's always best to consult with your podiatrist before choosing a treatment. Mild cases of athlete's foot can turn severe and even cause a serious bacterial infection. If you notice your rash has become increasingly red, swollen and painful or you develop blisters and sores, call our office right away.

There are over 100 different types of arthritis. Symptoms If you have arthritis, you may experience: Joint pain Joint swelling Reduced ability to move the joint Redness of the skin around a joint Stiffness, especially in the morning Warmth around a joint Treatment and Care Treatment of arthritis depends on the particular cause, which joints are affected, severity, and how the condition affects your daily activities. Your age and occupation will also be taken into consideration when your doctor works with you to create a treatment plan. If possible, treatment will focus on eliminating the underlying cause of the arthritis. However, the cause is NOT necessarily curable, as with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment, therefore, aims at reducing your pain and discomfort and preventing further disability. It is possible to greatly improve your symptoms from osteoarthritis and other long-term types of arthritis without medications. In fact, making lifestyle changes without medications is preferable for osteoarthritis and other forms of joint inflammation. If needed, medications should be used in addition to lifestyle changes. Exercise for arthritis is necessary to maintain healthy joints, relieve stiffness, reduce pain and fatigue, and improve muscle and bone strength. Your exercise program should be tailored to you as an individual. Work with a physical therapist to design an individualized program, which should include: Low-impact aerobic activity (also called endurance exercise) Range of motion exercises for flexibility Strength training for muscle tone A physical therapist can apply heat and cold treatments as needed and fit you for splints or orthotic (straightening) devices to support and align joints. This may be particularly necessary for rheumatoid arthritis. Your physical therapist may also consider water therapy, ice massage, or transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS). Rest is just as important as exercise. Sleeping 8 to 10 hours per night and taking naps during the day can help you recover from a flare-up more quickly and may even help prevent exacerbations. You should also: Avoid holding one position for too long. Avoid positions or movements that place extra stress on your affected joints. Modify your home to make activities easier. For example, have grab bars in the shower, the tub, and near the toilet. Reduce stress, which can aggravate your symptoms. Try meditation or guided imagery. And talk to your physical therapist about yoga or tai chi. Other measures to try include: Apply capsaicin cream (derived from hot chili peppers) to the skin over your painful joints. You may feel improvement after applying the cream for 3-7 days. Eat a diet rich in vitamins and minerals, especially antioxidants like vitamin E. These are found in fruits and vegetables. Get selenium from Brewer's yeast, wheat germ, garlic, whole grains, sunflower seeds, and Brazil nuts. Get omega-3 fatty acids from cold water fish (like salmon, mackerel, and herring), flaxseed, rapeseed (canola) oil, soybeans, soybean oil, pumpkin seeds, and walnuts. Taking glucosamine and chondroitin — these form the building blocks of cartilage, the substance that lines joints. These supplements are available at health food stores or supermarkets.

Osteoarthritis, the most common type of arthritis that wears away the cartilage cushioning the knee joint, currently affects more than 27 million people in the Asian. Most Indians are unaware of the seriousness of arthritis and the impact it can have on their lives. Arthritis is the nation's most common cause of disability and costs the Indian economy more than $128 billion annually. Knee osteoarthritis, the most frequent form of lower extremity arthritis, contributes to 418,000 knee replacement procedures annually and in 2010 accounted for 496,000 hospital discharges and $19 billion in hospital charges. One of the largest longitudinal studies to monitor the onset and progression of knee and hip osteoarthritis suggests nearly one in two people (46%) will develop painful knee osteoarthritis over their lifetime, with the highest risk among those who are obese. The study found that a person's lifetime risk rose as their body mass index or BMI increased, with the greatest risk found in those whose weight was normal at age 18 but were overweight or obese at 45 or older. While there were no significant differences in risk by sex, race and education, the study found that nearly two in three people (65%) who are obese would develop knee osteoarthritis over their lifetime. The study also found that those with a prior knee injury had a lifetime risk of 57%.

qid_144,neutral,music therapy depression,Can music therapy help manage depression?,"Music therapy has been shown to be an effective adjunctive treatment for depression, particularly when combined with traditional treatments such as medication and psychotherapy [0]. Research has consistently demonstrated that music therapy can reduce symptoms of depression, improve mood, and enhance overall mental health [2, 3]. A study published in the Journal of Music Therapy found that music therapy significantly reduced symptoms of depression in individuals with major depressive disorder [3]. Another study published in the Journal of Affective Disorders found that music therapy was effective in reducing symptoms of depression in older adults . The mechanisms by which music therapy may help manage depression are not fully understood, but several theories have been proposed [4]. One theory is that music therapy may help to reduce stress and anxiety, which are common comorbidities with depression [5]. Another theory is that music therapy may help to increase self-esteem and confidence, which can be negatively impacted by depression . In addition to its potential therapeutic benefits, music therapy is also a low-cost and accessible form of treatment, making it an attractive option for individuals who may not have access to traditional forms of therapy [6, 7]. Furthermore, music therapy can be adapted to meet the needs of individuals with depression, including those with cognitive or physical impairments [8]. In conclusion, music therapy has been shown to be a valuable adjunctive treatment for depression, and may be particularly beneficial for individuals who are unable to access traditional forms of therapy. While the mechanisms by which music therapy works are not fully understood, it is clear that it can have a positive impact on symptoms of depression and overall mental health. Gold, C., & Solli, H.

The inability to take and withstand deep breaths is crucial to the body's overall makeup; struggling to do so can lead to many issues. A recent study that was published recently, showed that additional research is linking the benefits of vitamin D supplements to those who struggle with asthma. This condition affects more than 300 million people worldwide and is the cause of over 400,000 deaths a year. While specific safety measures have been taken for many, trying to eradicate this dangerous condition has been a longstanding hope. Viral upper respiratory infections can often trigger these asthma attacks and they tend to make the overall symptoms much worse than what they would be otherwise. The study found that vitamin D actually works against the attacks by almost immediately boosting the immune system and counteracting the respiratory viruses. It helps to mitigate the inflammation that is often experienced in the lungs during such attacks. This is the primary cause of the biggest issues as the inflammation becomes harmful and obstructive to the airways. Vitamin D Supplements The study took the individual data of over 950 participants and tested the specific use of vitamin D supplements. The findings were extraordinary. There was at least a 30 percent reduction in the amount of asthma attacks that required injections or steroid tablets. There was a 50 percent reduction in the risk of experiencing an asthma attack so extreme it requires hospitalization or urgent care attendance. That's a drop from about a six percent occurrence to a three percent occurrence. The dosages of the vitamin D supplementation were found to be safe; no side effects that affected calcium levels or renal stones were detected.

Some studies suggest that vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the development and severity of asthma, while others have found no association [0]. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 randomized controlled trials found that vitamin D supplementation did not significantly reduce asthma symptoms or improve lung function in patients with asthma [1]. However, the review also noted that the quality of the evidence was generally low, and that further research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and risks of vitamin D supplementation for asthma management. In terms of the mechanisms by which vitamin D may influence asthma, several theories have been proposed. For example, vitamin D may help to regulate the immune response and reduce inflammation in the airways, which could potentially improve asthma symptoms [2]. Vitamin D may also help to modulate the expression of genes involved in the development and function of airway smooth muscle, which could potentially improve lung function [3].

Based on the context references, I will provide a full and complete answer to your question. Vitamin D supplements may potentially improve the management of asthma. According to the article ""Vitamin D as an Adjunctive Therapy in Asthma. Part A Review of Potential Mechanisms"" by Conor Kerley et al. vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is highly prevalent worldwide and shares several common risk factors with asthma, including high latitude, winter season, industrialization, poor diet, obesity, and dark skin pigmentation [0, 0]. The article suggests that vitamin D has been demonstrated to possess potent immunomodulatory effects, including effects on T cells and B cells as well as increasing production of antimicrobial peptides (e.g. cathelicidin) [0]. These immunomodulatory effects may lead to asthma-specific clinical benefits in terms of decreased bacterial/viral infections, altered airway smooth muscle-remodeling and function, as well as modulation of response to standard anti-asthma therapy (e.g. glucocorticoids and immunotherapy) [0]. The article also highlights that vitamin D receptors and vitamin D metabolic enzymes have been discovered in numerous sites systemically, supporting diverse extra-skeletal roles of vitamin D, including its potential role in asthmatic disease [0]. Furthermore, the article suggests that vitamin D may influence asthmatic disease by altering the course of disease pathogenesis and severity [0] While the article does not explicitly state that vitamin D supplements can improve the management of asthma, it provides a comprehensive review of the potential mechanisms whereby altering vitamin D status may influence asthmatic disease. Therefore, it can be inferred that vitamin D supplements may potentially improve the management of asthma by modulating the immune system and reducing the severity of the disease. In conclusion, based on the context references, vitamin D supplements may potentially improve the management of asthma by modulating the immune system and reducing the severity of the disease.

qid_149,neutral,hip osteoarthritis at-home exercises,Will at-home exercises manage hip osteoarthritis pain?,"Thank you for your instruction. I will provide a full and complete answer for your question. Hip osteoarthritis is a common condition characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in the hip joint, leading to pain, stiffness, and limited mobility [0]. While at-home exercises can be beneficial in managing hip osteoarthritis pain, it is essential to note that a comprehensive treatment plan should include a combination of exercises, lifestyle modifications, and professional guidance from a healthcare provider or physical therapist. At-home exercises can help improve hip mobility, strength, and flexibility, which can reduce pain and stiffness associated with hip osteoarthritis [1]. For example, exercises such as hip flexion, hip abduction, and hip rotation can be performed at home with the guidance of a healthcare provider or physical therapist [2]. Additionally, exercises that target the surrounding muscles, such as the gluteus medius and tensor fasciae latae, can help stabilize the hip joint and reduce pain [3]. However, it is crucial to note that at-home exercises should be performed under the guidance of a healthcare provider or physical therapist to ensure proper technique and progression [4]. Furthermore, exercises should be tailored to the individual's specific needs and abilities, and should not exacerbate the condition [5]. In conclusion, while at-home exercises can be beneficial in managing hip osteoarthritis pain, it is essential to work with a healthcare provider or physical therapist to develop a comprehensive treatment plan that includes a combination of exercises, lifestyle modifications, and professional guidance.

The study conducted by Svege et al. suggests that exercise therapy may postpone total hip replacement surgery in patients with hip osteoarthritis [0]. The study found that patients who participated in a 12-week exercise therapy program, in addition to patient education, reported better WOMAC results and had a median time to total hip replacement of 5.4 years, compared to 3.5 years in the control group. Regarding at-home exercises, the study did not specifically focus on this aspect. However, it is mentioned that the exercise therapy program was specifically designed for patients with hip OA and consisted of strengthening, flexibility, and functional exercises [0]. This implies that exercises can be tailored to the individual's needs and can be performed at home. In another study, Arokoski et al. found that physical function in men with hip osteoarthritis was associated with pain and stiffness [1]. This suggests that exercises that improve physical function, such as strengthening and flexibility exercises, may help alleviate pain and stiffness associated with hip osteoarthritis. Dieppe et al. and Lohmander et al. also emphasize the importance of exercise in managing osteoarthritis pain [2, 3]. They suggest that exercise can help reduce pain and improve function in patients with osteoarthritis. In conclusion, while the study did not specifically focus on at-home exercises, it suggests that exercise therapy can be beneficial in managing hip osteoarthritis pain. At-home exercises that focus on strengthening, flexibility, and functional exercises may be a useful adjunct to traditional treatment and can help alleviate pain and stiffness associated with hip osteoarthritis.

As the cartilage wears away, the joint becomes frail and rough, while the protective joint space between the hip bones decreases. To compensate for the lost cartilage, the damaged bones may form bone spurs that grow outwards, also known as osteophytes. This blog post discusses the causes, symptoms, and treatment exercises for hip osteoarthritis. Read on. Must read: The Treatment of Arthritis, Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis What are the Causes? 1. Advanced age Hips go through significant wear and tear over a lifetime, and the cartilage also becomes less flexible with age. Individuals aged 45 years or more often begin to develop symptoms of hip osteoarthritis, while those aged between 60 and 70 years are more prone to be affected by the condition. 2. Heredity and congenital defects and disease According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, it is estimated that 50 percent of hip arthritis cases are hereditary. Some individuals may inherit characteristics or diseases that eventually culminate into osteoarthritis, such as congenital hip dislocation, poor bone alignment, metabolic disorders, and rheumatoid arthritis. 3. Joint trauma or injury Joint trauma or injury such as a broken hip or surgery, can develop into hip osteoarthritis years later. Athletes participating in direct impact sports such as hockey and football, are also at an increased risk. Must Read: Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis: Understanding the Difference 4. Gender Women are mostly affected by hip osteoarthritis. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, while 8.3 percent of male population above 45 years of age are prone to hip osteoarthritis, the number of women above is significantly higher with 11.3 percent. Symptoms 1. Pain in the hip, groin, or thigh Any signs of prolonged aching, and stiffness in the buttock, groin, or thigh, can be because of hip osteoarthritis. Often individuals experience back pain or in the sides, while standing upright or bearing weight. This pain may permeate down the thigh, into the knee and cause discomfort. By taking adequate rest, the pain subsides. 2. Decreased motion range Hip osteoarthritis makes it very difficult to spread the legs apart, point toes inward while rotating the leg, and extend the leg straight back. The joint can also swell up and become irritated because of the increased friction between the pelvic bone and the femur. As a result, the surrounding muscles which support the hip joint swell up and starts to pain. Further Read : Knee Osteoarthritis: Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatment 3.

qid_149,neutral,hip osteoarthritis at-home exercises,Will at-home exercises manage hip osteoarthritis pain?,"Based on the provided context references, it is possible to manage hip osteoarthritis pain with at-home exercises. The context references suggest that exercise is one of the best treatments for osteoarthritis [0]. Specifically, it is recommended to do some type of exercise daily, and studies show that people who exercise daily achieve the greatest improvement in pain and function, compared with those who exercise less often [0]. The context references also provide specific exercises that can be done at home, such as range-of-motion exercises, muscle-strengthening exercises, and aerobic exercises. Range-of-motion exercises involve gently moving a joint as far as possible in every direction without causing pain [0]. Muscle-strengthening exercises increase structural support for the joints, lessening the load placed on them [0]. Aerobic exercises, such as swimming, walking, and bicycling, are excellent ways to improve fitness and can be done at home [0]. Additionally, the context references suggest that it is important to get the right balance between rest and exercise. Resting involves more than simply avoiding an activity that causes pain. Some people find that relaxation techniques, stress reduction, and biofeedback improve their resting time [0]. However, it is important to note that it is recommended to consult a physical therapist to develop an exercise program that is tailored to the individual's age, physical condition, and the severity of their symptoms [0]. A physical therapist can also provide guidance on how to do the exercises correctly and monitor progress. In conclusion, at-home exercises can be an effective way to manage hip osteoarthritis pain, but it is important to consult a physical therapist to develop a personalized exercise program.
