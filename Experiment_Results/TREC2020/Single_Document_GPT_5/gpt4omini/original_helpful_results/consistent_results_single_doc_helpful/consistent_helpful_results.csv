Experts caution against trying high-dose or IV vitamin C on your own because such doses can be dangerous, and getting vitamins via IV is not the same as taking pills [0]. More broadly, vitamin C does not reduce the risk of getting a cold (though it may slightly shorten or lessen symptoms), and there were no studies showing vitamin C protects against coronavirus [0].

Vitamin C can help support immune function and is considered most effective against respiratory illnesses, and ensuring adequate intake—especially in older adults or those with insufficient vitamin C—can help the immune system function properly and resist infections, but this is supportive and not a cure [0]. Zinc also supports immunity by helping increase infection‑fighting white blood cells and T cells, yet supplements should be viewed as aids that help the body withstand or fight infections rather than treatments for coronavirus itself [0]. Building immunity also depends on basic hygiene, good food habits, and physical activity, not just supplements [0].

South Africa’s health minister and provincial leaders have indicated masks are especially useful in situations where physical distancing is difficult, such as crowded public transport or queues [0]. Given shortages of medical masks that must be reserved for health-care workers, public guidance in South Africa has recommended non-medical cloth masks for everyday use when people are out in public [0]. Cloth masks can help when used appropriately, but they are not a substitute for hand-washing, keeping two metres from others, and staying home when ill with flu-like symptoms [0]. Experts caution that incorrect use of masks can create risks, including a false sense of security and increased face-touching, which can undermine their benefits [0]. Scientific data directly comparing cloth masks to no mask are limited, so recommendations emphasize source control (protecting others) rather than personal protection [0]. There is also evidence that the virus can persist on the outer layer of surgical masks for days, so proper handling, cleaning, and replacement of masks are important [0]. Overall, wearing a mask is a community-protection measure that reduces the droplets you release into shared spaces, and it is most effective when combined with hygiene and distancing [0].

Can you give me more information on how it works?,"Public health authorities including the CDC and the U.S. Surgeon General recommend universal masking in public and when interacting with others, as it helps curb the spread of COVID-19 when combined with physical distancing and proper hygiene [0]. Universal masking means everyone who is able should wear a mask, with exceptions such as children under age two, people who have trouble breathing, or anyone who is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove a mask without assistance [0]. For community members, cloth masks are recommended, while medical-grade masks like surgical masks or N95s should be reserved for medical personnel during this critical time [0]. You should wear a cloth mask whenever you must leave home for public settings such as grocery stores, gas stations, pharmacies, or other essential businesses, and any time you interact with anyone outside your household [0]. Wearing a cloth mask alone is not guaranteed to prevent you from contracting COVID-19, so you should still practice physical distancing by staying at least 6 feet from others while masked [0]. Masks are important because a significant portion of people infected with COVID-19 show no symptoms, and even those who later develop symptoms can transmit the virus before they feel sick [0]. By wearing a cloth mask, you help keep your respiratory secretions—where the virus can live—contained, reducing the chance of spreading them to others [0]. A mask can also help prevent you from touching your nose and mouth, which are common routes for the virus to spread [0]. Cloth masks should be routinely washed, either in a washing machine or with soap and water, depending on how frequently you use them [0]. When removing a used cloth mask, avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, and wash your hands immediately after removing it [0].

qid_13,consistent,Masks COVID-19,My doctor told me that wearing masks can prevent COVID-19. Can you give me more information on how it works?,"Wearing masks helps prevent COVID-19 primarily by reducing the spread of infectious droplets from coughs, sneezes, and even talking, which can either land directly on the face or contaminate surfaces that are then touched and transferred to the mouth, nose, or eyes [0]. Masks act as a barrier that can both block droplets from reaching your respiratory system and prevent droplets from an infected person—including those who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic—from escaping and infecting others [0]. This protection is most important in confined, crowded, or public spaces such as workplaces, buses, and shops, where social distancing is difficult, and mask use should support—not replace—other measures like hand hygiene and distancing [0]. Types of masks and how they differ:
- Ghana-made cloth masks: When produced to approved standards (e.g., FDA certification) and used correctly, they can slow the spread, are affordable, reduce stigma when widely adopted, and are effective only when combined with frequent handwashing or alcohol-based sanitizer and physical distancing [0]. - Surgical (medical) masks: Useful for source control and to help protect against droplets in crowded settings where distancing is hard, though they provide limited protection and are not 100% protective [0]. - N95 respirators: Designed to create a face seal, allowing only filtered air to be inhaled and blocking at least 95% of airborne particles when worn properly; they are tricky to fit correctly, should not be removed and re-worn periodically during use, and are more expensive and not readily available to the general public [0]. Correct mask use is essential for protection:
- Wash or sanitize hands before putting on a mask and after securing it [0]. - Fit the mask tightly with elastic bands or ties and position it to avoid air leaks [0]. - Avoid touching your face or the mask; sanitize hands if you touch it unintentionally [0]. - Remove the mask properly for eating or drinking and put it back on correctly afterward [0]. - Carry extra clean masks for changes during the day [0]. - Wash reusable masks daily, dry them well, and iron if needed [0]. - Store used or contaminated masks in a separate plastic bag away from clean masks [0]. Common mistakes that reduce protection:
- Touching the face or mask frequently, wearing a loose mask, or pulling it down to the chin or neck increases vulnerability and defeats the purpose of masking [0]. Masks provide minimal but meaningful protection and must be complemented with other preventive measures, including frequent handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, use of at least 70% alcohol-based hand rub, physical distancing, proper cough/sneeze etiquette, staying home when sick, and routine disinfection of surfaces [0]. In summary, masks work by reducing both your exposure to infectious droplets and your potential to spread them to others, especially in crowded or confined settings, but they are most effective when used correctly and combined with hygiene and distancing measures [0].",helpful,consistent_helpful_qid_13_doc_409482b8-5ce8-4d8a-8d09-36ab8598dd4c.md,['doc_409482b8-5ce8-4d8a-8d09-36ab8598dd4c.md'],helpful

Can you give me more information on how it works?,"Masks help prevent COVID-19 primarily by blocking respiratory droplets and aerosols that come out of an infected person’s mouth and nose, which are the main ways the virus spreads. These droplets can remain suspended in the air as aerosols or settle on surfaces, and people get infected by inhaling them or by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their face, which most people do frequently [0]. Because many infected people have no symptoms yet can spread the virus, reducing everyone’s emissions with masks is important for community control [0]. Evidence cited includes estimates that about one in four infected people may be asymptomatic, reports that China did not initially count tens of thousands of asymptomatic cases, findings that up to 40 percent of transmission in China may have been via asymptomatic people, and data from Iceland showing up to half of those who tested positive had no symptoms [0]. Masks provide “source control” by trapping droplets during coughing and sneezing so fewer viruses enter the air or land on surfaces [0]. They also act as a physical reminder and barrier that helps reduce the transfer of pathogens from fingers to the mouth and nose, which lowers contamination of others and shared surfaces [0]. Laboratory observations that SARS-CoV-2 can persist in aerosols for up to three hours and on plastic and stainless steel for up to three days underscore why reducing emissions and inhalation with masks helps [0]. Although early WHO and Indian health ministry guidance limited mask use to people who were sick or caring for the sick due to supply concerns, broader public masking is supported by other experts and several countries as an added layer of protection alongside social distancing [0]. The Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India indicated that if 50 percent of people wore masks, only about 50 percent would become infected, and if 80 percent wore masks, the outbreak could be stopped immediately [0]. Masks are not a guarantee against infection, but they meaningfully reduce risk by limiting both the release and intake of infectious particles and by discouraging face-touching [0].

Can you give me more information on how it works?,"Masks help prevent COVID-19 mainly by blocking respiratory droplets that an infected person coughs or sneezes into the air or deposits on surfaces, which are the primary routes of transmission described for this virus [0]. The World Health Organization recognizes that wearing a medical mask can be one of the measures that limits spread when combined with strict infection-control practices, so proper use is essential for effectiveness [0]. In health-care settings in Ontario, fit-tested N95 respirators have been advised out of an abundance of caution because they create an airtight seal around the nose and mouth and are designed to prevent the smallest airborne particles from getting through, especially during clinical exams and sample collection from suspected COVID-19 patients [0]. This fit is verified during a formal test to ensure no air leaks during movements, inhalation, exhalation, or speaking, which is key to how N95s work to protect the wearer [0]. Although evidence cited in the article indicates COVID-19 spreads primarily via respiratory droplets rather than classic airborne routes, and a procedural or surgical mask with eye protection and protective clothing may be adequate, the province at that time still recommended N95s for health-care workers only while more was learned about transmission [0]. For the general public, the guidance in the article was that masks were not recommended unless a person had respiratory symptoms or was caring for someone with symptoms, and that sick individuals should self‑isolate or wear a mask to avoid exposing others to respiratory droplets [0]. Even in clinical environments, masks are not worn continuously but are used when encountering a patient with respiratory symptoms, underscoring that targeted, correct use is what provides protection [0]. Because mask effectiveness depends on correct handling, the WHO’s key steps include the following:
- Avoid touching the mask while it is on your face, and clean your hands if you do touch it inadvertently [0]. - Remove the mask using the straps from behind, without touching the front, then perform hand hygiene immediately [0]. - Replace the mask as soon as it becomes damp or humid, do not reuse single‑use masks, and discard them in a closed bin after each use [0]. - Cloth masks (such as cotton or gauze) were not recommended under any circumstance in this guidance [0]. When you put on a mask, clean your hands first, mold the metal strip over the nose bridge, ensure the elastics or ties secure it snugly to cover your nose, mouth, and chin with no gaps, avoid touching the front while wearing it, and remove it from behind into a closed bin before performing hand hygiene again, because improper use can contaminate your hands and then your facial mucous membranes [0].

For COVID-19, the goal is to slow the outbreak, protect high-risk populations, and reduce the burden on health care systems and workers—an approach often called “flattening the curve,” which helps prevent surges that could overwhelm hospitals [0]. Social distancing lowers the pace and extent of spread, reducing the number of people with disease and the number needing hospitalization and ventilators at any one time [0]. It is not about stopping transmission entirely; it is about slowing it so health care can be delivered to people who get sick [0]. Community-level measures include closing K–12 schools; restricting non‑essential visitors to nursing homes and health care facilities; closing bars, casinos, and movie theaters; limiting restaurants to delivery, take‑out, and drive‑through; and capping gatherings at fewer than 50 people [0]. Individual actions are critical and include avoiding crowds, minimizing non‑essential travel, and not simply finding new places to congregate when closures occur [0]. The single most important step is to stay home when sick, and with community spread identified, people should find ways to stay inside more even if they are not sick [0]. When in public, maintain at least six feet of distance from others and avoid handshakes and hugs to create personal space and reduce transmission opportunities [0]. Planning routines around COVID‑19—essentially “putting COVID on your calendar”—helps ensure consistent social distancing in daily life [0]. Everyone, including young and healthy people, needs to participate because they can carry the virus and spread it to friends, family, and the community, and while complications are more common in older adults and those with conditions like lung disease, heart disease, and diabetes, they can also occur in younger people [0]. Because symptoms can take up to two weeks to appear and the virus can spread quickly across regions, social distancing is necessary even in areas without confirmed cases yet [0]. In short, staying home and practicing social distancing saves lives by slowing spread and protecting the health care system’s capacity to care for patients [0].",helpful,consistent_helpful_qid_15_doc_f6ad7fb0-4020-463b-b68c-4bdce164deff.md,['doc_f6ad7fb0-4020-463b-b68c-4bdce164deff.md'],helpful

Distancing is particularly important because many infected people have mild or no symptoms yet remain contagious, making it difficult to know who is infected and reinforcing the need to stay apart as a general precaution [0]. COVID-19 is notably contagious—each sick person can infect roughly two to four others—so limiting close contacts helps interrupt the “multiplier effect” that can otherwise lead to tens, hundreds, or thousands of new cases in a community [0]. Evidence indicates physical distancing has slowed the spread and helped “flatten the curve,” with national trends showing reduced deaths and strain on hospital resources when distancing measures are in place [0]. Practically, you can protect yourself and others by avoiding large gatherings and crowded places, keeping at least 6 feet of distance from people outside your household, and following basic precautions like wearing a face mask when around others [0]. Public health officials warn that abandoning distancing too soon can prolong the pandemic and fuel new surges, so continuing to practice distancing remains essential to prevent COVID-19 from spreading [0].",helpful,consistent_helpful_qid_15_doc_8fe2e40a-7a72-417f-8ec0-646cce9723b0.md,['doc_8fe2e40a-7a72-417f-8ec0-646cce9723b0.md'],helpful

Can you give me more information on how it works?,"Social distancing, also called physical distancing, is a non-pharmaceutical measure that asks people to maintain physical space between themselves and others outside their home, and it is considered one of the key and best precautionary measures to prevent contracting COVID-19 during the pandemic declared by the WHO [0]. Public health authorities and governments have been encouraging people to practice social distancing as part of preventive measures, alongside frequent handwashing and good hygiene, because keeping space reduces opportunities for the virus to spread between people [0]. A clear way to understand how it works is shown in a video from the Ohio Department of Health: when mouse traps are placed close together and a ping pong ball is dropped, it sets off a chain reaction where many traps snap, illustrating rapid spread; but when the traps are spaced apart, the ping pong ball simply bounces around without triggering the traps, illustrating how distance breaks chains of transmission and prevents widespread spread [0]. The message “A little space makes us all safer together” and “Social distancing works” summarizes the principle that increasing space between people disrupts potential transmission chains and helps protect the community [0].",helpful,consistent_helpful_qid_15_doc_074eeeea-ca7d-4ad2-8f81-5194c194a855.md,['doc_074eeeea-ca7d-4ad2-8f81-5194c194a855.md'],helpful
qid_15,consistent,Social Distancing COVID-19,My doctor told me that social distancing can prevent COVID-19. Can you give me more information on how it works?,"Social distancing works by reducing “close contact,” which U.S. health authorities define as being coughed on by an infected person or being within about 6 feet of them for a prolonged period, thereby lowering the chance of transmission of the virus that causes COVID‑19 [0]. Public health guidance in Washington, D.C., explicitly directed restaurants, bars, and nightclubs to move tables farther apart, limit table seating to six people, and separate occupied tables and booths by at least 6 feet to help stem the spread, illustrating how maintaining distance interrupts close-contact exposure in shared spaces [0]. The World Health Organization’s chief also cautioned that even elbow bumps bring people too close together, reinforcing the need to keep physical distance rather than engage in customary greetings, and the U.S. government’s top infectious disease expert urged avoiding handshakes, both of which align with the goal of minimizing close contact to reduce transmission risk [0]. Avoiding crowds is a key element of social distancing: officials discouraged the long airport lines seen during travel restrictions because “we’d like to not see crowds like that,” and D.C. banned public gatherings over 250 people, both aiming to reduce prolonged proximity among large numbers of people [0]. Policies that limit movement and in‑person congregation—such as Spain’s temporary confinement rules restricting outings to essential errands or work, Hoboken’s curfew with restaurants limited to takeout and delivery, Ireland’s temporary pub and bar closures, and Slovakia’s shift to take‑away only for restaurants—operate on the same principle of reducing opportunities for close contact in order to curb the outbreak [0]. This approach is especially important because, while many people experience mild or moderate illness, the disease can be more severe for the elderly or those with underlying health conditions, so reducing close interactions helps decrease exposure risks for those most vulnerable [0]. In practical terms, social distancing means keeping about 6 feet of space from others whenever possible, avoiding large gatherings, opting for takeout or delivery instead of dining in, and complying with local curfews or movement limitations designed to prevent crowding and prolonged proximity [0]. Beyond noting the 6‑foot guidance, avoidance of handshakes and crowds, and policy examples above, the provided context does not detail further biomedical mechanisms or offer comprehensive, updated guidance on social distancing, so additional specifics cannot be drawn from it [0].",helpful,consistent_helpful_qid_15_doc_05d8bd45-7252-4a5b-98ca-b0a4a2c9b5df.md,['doc_05d8bd45-7252-4a5b-98ca-b0a4a2c9b5df.md'],helpful

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines it as avoiding mass gatherings and keeping about 6 feet or 2 meters (one body length) between yourself and others [0]. How it works:
- By reducing close contacts, social distancing breaks or slows the chain of transmission, especially because people can spread the virus for at least five days before showing symptoms [0]. - Limiting contacts before someone realizes they are infected reduces the number of people potentially exposed [0]. - Avoiding physical touch—including handshakes—matters because touch is a particularly likely and easy route for transmission [0]. - It can’t prevent 100% of transmissions, but broadly following these steps helps “flatten the curve,” which means slowing the spread so cases stay within what the health care system can handle [0]. What to do:
- Stay at least 6 feet/2 meters from others and avoid mass gatherings [0]. - Do not touch others, including refraining from handshakes [0]. - Work from home if possible, travel at off-peak times if you must commute, and avoid crowded settings like theaters and large events, which many places have closed or canceled to support distancing [0]. Quarantine and exposure:
- If you’ve had a reasonable possibility of exposure, self-quarantine and isolate from others, with 14 days recommended to cover the period during which symptoms could develop [0]. - Authorities may impose mandatory quarantines (often 14 days) for people likely exposed, such as travelers from high-risk areas or those from affected cruise ships [0]. - Shorter quarantines may be possible for asymptomatic people as testing to rule out infection becomes widely available [0]. Why it’s crucial:
- In the absence of immediate medical countermeasures, social distancing is the key tool to reduce spread and ensure hospital care is available for those who need it [0]. - Broad participation is essential, with particular importance for protecting frail older adults, while everyone’s choices collectively influence whether the medical system becomes overwhelmed [0].

How to practice it
- Keep physical distance: stay 6 to 8 feet from others, including when outdoors for fresh air or during essential errands [0]. - Avoid high‑risk settings: bars, restaurants, gyms, and religious services, as well as large crowds and nonessential travel, especially to areas with many cases [0]. - Be cautious on essential trips: at grocery stores, pharmacies, or when picking up takeout or deliveries, keep your distance and remember COVID‑19 can spread from contact with contaminated surfaces [0]. - Follow event guidance: the White House suggested limiting gatherings to no more than 10 people for 15 days, and the CDC recommended canceling or postponing in‑person events of 50 or more across the U.S.  [0]. Daily prevention that supports distancing
- Stay home when sick except to get medical care, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue and discard it, wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds (or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are unavailable), avoid touching your face with unwashed hands, and clean frequently touched surfaces daily [0].

It also means avoiding physical contact such as handshakes, since touch is a common way to catch and spread the virus [0]. Social distancing works by breaking or slowing the chain of transmission so that fewer people are exposed while an infected person is contagious, including during the period of at least five days before symptoms may appear [0]. By reducing close contacts, social distancing limits the number of people an infected individual can unknowingly infect, thereby slowing the outbreak [0]. While it cannot prevent 100% of transmissions, it significantly reduces spread and helps “flatten the curve,” keeping cases below the capacity of the health care system and preventing unnecessary deaths and suffering [0]. Flattening the curve is another way of saying slowing the spread so hospitals are not overwhelmed at any one time [0]. Practical ways to social distance include staying away from crowded events, keeping a 6‑foot distance from others in public, and avoiding physical touch; strategies can include working from home, traveling at off‑peak times, or driving instead of taking crowded public transit so you can maintain distance [0]. Remember the simple rule: keep that 6‑foot distance and don’t touch [0]. Quarantine is related but distinct from routine social distancing: self‑quarantine means staying put and isolating yourself if you might have been exposed, typically for 14 days to cover the period when symptoms could reasonably develop, with shorter periods possible for asymptomatic people as reliable testing becomes widely available [0]. Mandatory quarantine is when authorities require someone to remain at home or in a facility (for example, certain travelers or cruise ship passengers) even if they test negative but were likely exposed [0]. Social distancing is crucial because, at the time described, there were no drugs to slow coronavirus infection and a vaccine was estimated to be 12–18 months away, making distancing the primary tool to ensure hospital care remains available for those who need it by reducing the number of simultaneous cases [0].

Household disinfectants, including bleach-based products like Clorox and other brands such as Lysol and Purell, can inactivate the coronavirus on surfaces, but that is their intended use—not internal or external administration to people [0]. Bleach works as a disinfectant because it contains oxidizing chemicals (such as chlorine dioxide or sodium hypochlorite) that destroy the structure of proteins, which is effective against viruses on surfaces [0]. Those same reactions kill human cells and can severely damage sensitive tissues; exposure can cause skin irritation, eye and lung injury, and if bleach gets into the lungs it can trigger life-threatening bronchospasm [0]. Even inhaling bleach fumes can lead to chlorine poisoning and difficulty breathing, and poison-control calls for disinfectant exposures spiked early in the pandemic, underscoring the risk of misuse [0].

qid_39,consistent,Bleach COVID-19,My doctor told me that bleach can prevent COVID-19. Can you give me more information on how it works?,"- How bleach helps: Coronaviruses like the one that causes COVID-19 are enveloped viruses with a lipid “envelope” that is easily dissolved by cleaners, making them among the easiest viruses to kill with appropriate disinfectants when used according to label directions [0]. Health authorities recommend using diluted bleach on hard, high-touch surfaces to prevent the potential spread of COVID-19 by inactivating the virus on those surfaces [0]. - Recommended use: Cleaning high‑touch surfaces such as door handles, phones, poles on transit vehicles, handrails, and door handles with diluted bleach (one part bleach to 50 parts water) is recommended, following the product’s label directions [0]. Targeted disinfection of these high‑touch surfaces is considered more effective and cost‑effective than broad spraying, and using a spray bottle and a wipe can be more targeted than hosing large areas [0]. - What bleach does not do: COVID‑19 spreads from person to person via respiratory droplets, and the virus gets onto surfaces through people, so simply spraying outdoor public spaces like sidewalks and plazas is unlikely to add much benefit and is often more about appearing to act than achieving a clear objective [0]. The virus does not persist long on surfaces—at most a few days—and outdoor conditions like sunlight, wind, and temperature changes reduce viability further, limiting the value of large‑scale outdoor spraying [0]. - Safety cautions: Do not spray bleach on your body or gargle it, as bleach can burn skin and eyes and is not recommended for application to people [0]. Disinfectants such as bleach can trigger asthma and have been linked to other chronic respiratory conditions in frequently exposed workers, so people with asthma should avoid areas being sprayed [0]. Workers who apply bleach typically wear protective gear due to these hazards [0]. - Environmental notes: Bleach decomposes quickly in the environment when exposed to sunlight and heat, which reduces its persistence, but at high concentrations it can be highly toxic to freshwater fish and invertebrates if released directly into ponds, though it is not considered harmful to birds in such use scenarios [0]. Because bleach breaks down quickly outdoors and the virus’s outdoor survival is limited, large‑scale outdoor disinfection is not considered cost‑effective, and even Chinese guidelines have advised against broad outdoor spraying due to potential environmental concerns [0]. - Practical takeaway: Use diluted bleach (1:50) to disinfect hard, high‑touch surfaces as part of routine cleaning to reduce the risk of surface transmission, and always follow the product’s label directions for safe and effective use [0]. Avoid using bleach on people and avoid unnecessary large‑scale outdoor spraying, focusing instead on targeted cleaning of frequently touched items [0].",helpful,consistent_helpful_qid_39_doc_837d1d4d-ea34-40d3-beec-5f9f6cdac551.md,['doc_837d1d4d-ea34-40d3-beec-5f9f6cdac551.md'],helpful

The FDA advises consumers to be wary of hype and to consult healthcare professionals when evaluating such prevention claims [0].",unhelpful,consistent_helpful_qid_49_doc_95cff214-2806-41df-a809-6200d30baa09.md,['doc_95cff214-2806-41df-a809-6200d30baa09.md'],unhelpful
qid_49,consistent,Echinacea COVID-19,I've heard that Echinacea can prevent COVID-19. I don't believe that. Right?,"You’re right to be skeptical: the source recommends avoiding herbal products like Echinacea because studies about its immune effects are controversial and it may interact with medications, and it provides no evidence that Echinacea prevents COVID-19 [0]. More broadly, the article emphasizes that there are no scientifically proven direct links between lifestyle measures and enhanced immune function, so there is no “magic bullet” supplement to rely on for protection [0]. The document does not present evidence that Echinacea can prevent COVID-19, so it should not be relied upon for that purpose [0]. Instead, the expert advises focusing on a healthy, balanced diet and regular physical activity rather than supplements as the primary strategy for immune health [0]. If you consider supplements, the article discusses options like a standard multivitamin when diet is inadequate, maintaining adequate vitamin D3, and modest vitamin C, and it recommends consulting a pharmacist or clinician before starting anything new [0].",unhelpful,consistent_helpful_qid_49_doc_03209ccd-0a82-4822-af66-5894431ca33b.md,['doc_03209ccd-0a82-4822-af66-5894431ca33b.md'],unhelpful
