In fact, none of the dietary supplements commonly marketed for immunity, including vitamin D, have been shown to prevent infection with the coronavirus or to shorten the course of the illness [0]. While some trials have found that moderate vitamin D supplementation can lower the risk of colds and flu primarily in people with very low or deficient levels, experts emphasize that this evidence cannot be extrapolated to preventing or treating coronavirus because these viruses differ [0]. Taking large doses of single vitamins and minerals can also cause harm, and high doses of vitamin D can be toxic and are not metabolized efficiently without adequate magnesium [0]. Given the lack of evidence and potential risks, focusing on nutritious foods, adequate sleep, and exercise is recommended over high-dose supplements [0]. If supplements are used, a standard multivitamin to fill dietary gaps may be reasonable, but avoid products claiming to prevent or treat COVID-19, which regulators have warned against [0].",unhelpful,neutral_harmful_qid_1_doc_01e198e3-ec00-432d-92f0-cca8251db33d.md,['doc_01e198e3-ec00-432d-92f0-cca8251db33d.md'],unhelpful

The article notes COVID‑19 is currently treated as primarily droplet‑transmitted and that research on its transmission dynamics is still underway [0]. A microbiologist who helped isolate the virus explicitly hesitates to recommend public humidity interventions for COVID‑19 until properly tested [0]. Therefore, the most reliable protective measures remain droplet‑control practices such as regular handwashing, mask use for healthcare workers and symptomatic individuals, and physical distancing [0].

A similar pattern was reported in a Chinese cohort where 12.6% of 1,000 patients were smokers despite a national smoking prevalence around 28%, again raising questions rather than providing definitive answers [0]. French researchers proposed clinical trials using nicotine patches to test whether nicotine, not smoking, could influence infection risk or disease course by potentially affecting viral entry or modulating immune responses [0]. Crucially, the report emphasizes that smoking itself is harmful, is a risk factor for severe COVID-19, and can worsen lung involvement, so people should not start smoking or self-medicate with nicotine based on these hypotheses [0].

The CDC says the best way to clean your hands is washing with soap and water, and when that’s not possible you should use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol [0]. While the article mentions DIY recipes—including one using rubbing alcohol and another from Good Housekeeping that uses vodka—it does not establish that vodka-based mixtures meet the CDC’s ≥60% alcohol requirement or that they are effective, so this source does not support using vodka sanitizer to prevent COVID-19 [0]. If you use sanitizer, the CDC advises putting it on your hands, rubbing to cover all surfaces until dry for about 20 seconds, and notes it may be less effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy [0].

Effective hand sanitizers require about 60–80% alcohol by volume, and the World Health Organization’s recommended ethanol formulation contains 80% ethanol [0]. Although an ultra‑high‑proof vodka (about 88% ethanol) can be mixed with aloe to make roughly a 66% alcohol gel (e.g., three parts vodka to one part aloe), 66% is at the lower end of effectiveness and is weaker than the WHO formulation known to inactivate related coronaviruses [0]. WHO formulations (80% ethanol or 75% isopropanol with glycerol and a small amount of hydrogen peroxide) have been shown to inactivate SARS and MERS coronaviruses, which are related to the virus that causes COVID‑19 [0]. Accordingly, use a sanitizer that meets WHO-strength alcohol levels or wash hands with soap and water, which are the recommended measures to help slow the spread of coronavirus [0]. Alcohol-based sanitizers are for cleaning hands only—do not drink alcohol or bathe in it [0].
