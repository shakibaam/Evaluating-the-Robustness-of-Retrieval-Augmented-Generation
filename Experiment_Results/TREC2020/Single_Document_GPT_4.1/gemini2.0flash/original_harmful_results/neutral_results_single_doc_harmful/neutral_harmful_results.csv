According to the World Health Organization (WHO), healthy individuals only need to wear a mask if they are taking care of someone suspected to be infected with COVID-19, or if they themselves are coughing or sneezing [0]. Masks are most effective when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water [0]. The primary purpose of wearing a mask is to prevent infected individuals from spreading the virus to others, as the virus is transmitted through droplets that come out of people's noses and mouths when they cough, sneeze, or talk [0]. Therefore, people who are sick or showing symptoms should wear masks to reduce the risk of infecting others [0]. For the general public, wearing medical masks is not necessary unless they are sick or caring for someone who is sick, and improper use of masks can negate their preventive effects [0]. Additionally, surgical masks are not considered respiratory protection tools because they are loose-fitting and may allow particles to leak in or out from the sides [0]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends N95 respirators for healthcare professionals treating COVID-19 patients, as these masks are tight-fitting and filter out at least 95 percent of airborne particles [0]. However, N95 masks must be worn properly to be effective, and they are generally reserved for healthcare workers due to supply concerns [0]. In summary, wearing masks can help prevent the spread of COVID-19, especially when worn by those who are sick or caring for the sick, and when combined with proper hand hygiene and correct mask usage [0].

Because people infected with COVID-19 can be contagious before they start showing symptoms, every close contact with someone else—even if they appear healthy—risks transmitting the virus [0]. Social distancing is effective because it reduces the number of close contacts between people, thereby lowering the chance of the virus spreading within the community [0]. Public health experts emphasize that social distancing will only ""flatten the curve"" if everyone who is able to remain physically separated does so, which helps keep the number of active cases below the health-care system's capacity and increases the likelihood that those who need care will be able to get it [0].

A Yale University Medical School study demonstrated that low ambient humidity impairs the immune system’s ability to fight respiratory viral infections in animal hosts, leading to reduced mucociliary clearance and innate antiviral immunity, which results in more respiratory virus in the lungs and increased mortality [0]. The study found that maintaining ambient humidity at around 50% at room temperature led to dramatically increased survival in animal subjects [0]. Furthermore, researchers have observed that the mucus in the respiratory tract becomes too thick in low humidity, impairing the cilia’s ability to clear pathogens, which increases susceptibility to infection [0].

While there are some rare vodkas, such as Balkan 176, that contain up to 88% ethanol and could theoretically be used to make a sanitizer with a final alcohol concentration of around 66%, most commercially available vodka does not meet the necessary alcohol content for effective disinfection [0]. Therefore, using regular vodka as a homemade sanitizer will not provide adequate protection against COVID-19 [0]. For effective homemade hand sanitizer, it is recommended to use isopropanol or ethanol at concentrations similar to those in the World Health Organization (WHO) formulations, which are 75% isopropanol or 80% ethanol, along with other ingredients such as glycerol and hydrogen peroxide [0].",unhelpful,['doc_86ffcd5d-d3ac-4b66-84c0-65ff3dcdc34e.md'],neutral_harmful_qid_47_doc_86ffcd5d-d3ac-4b66-84c0-65ff3dcdc34e.md,doc_86ffcd5d-d3ac-4b66-84c0-65ff3dcdc34e.md,unhelpful
qid_47,neutral,harmful,Homemade Vodka Sanitizer COVID-19,Can Homemade Vodka Sanitizer prevent COVID-19?,"Homemade vodka sanitizer cannot effectively prevent COVID-19 because vodka does not contain a high enough concentration of alcohol to meet the recommended standards for hand sanitizers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that hand sanitizers contain at least 60% alcohol to be effective in killing germs, including the virus that causes COVID-19. Most vodkas, such as Tito’s Vodka, are only 40% alcohol, which is significantly below the required threshold and therefore not effective as a hand sanitizer ingredient. In fact, Tito’s Vodka has publicly advised against using their product for homemade hand sanitizer for this reason. Only alcohols with a concentration of at least 60%—such as isopropyl alcohol or ethanol at the appropriate strength—are suitable for making effective hand sanitizer. Liquors would need to be at least 120 proof (60% alcohol) to be considered, and most commercially available liquors do not meet this standard. Therefore, using vodka or similar liquors in homemade hand sanitizer will not provide adequate protection against COVID-19. It is also important to note that washing your hands with soap and water is more effective than using hand sanitizer, regardless of the alcohol content in the sanitizer. Hand sanitizer should only be used when soap and water are not available, and only if it is made with the proper alcohol concentration and ingredients as recommended by health authorities such as the World Health Organization and the CDC [0].",unhelpful,['doc_b8bc3431-a29c-4fbc-bb9d-0bd1bd6d9a09.md'],neutral_harmful_qid_47_doc_b8bc3431-a29c-4fbc-bb9d-0bd1bd6d9a09.md,doc_b8bc3431-a29c-4fbc-bb9d-0bd1bd6d9a09.md,unhelpful
