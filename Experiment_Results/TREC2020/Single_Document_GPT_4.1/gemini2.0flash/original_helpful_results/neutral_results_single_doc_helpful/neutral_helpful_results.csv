Following this, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended on March 17, 2020, that people with COVID-19 symptoms should avoid taking ibuprofen and instead use paracetamol, unless ibuprofen was specifically prescribed by a doctor. The WHO spokesperson emphasized that people should not use ibuprofen as self-medication for COVID-19 symptoms until further guidance was available, and that those already being treated with anti-inflammatory medications should consult healthcare professionals for advice.

Health authorities, including the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and the World Health Organisation (WHO), initially advised that ordinary people did not need to wear masks unless they were sick or caring for someone who was ill, emphasizing that hygiene and physical distancing were the best protections [0]. However, as concern grew that infected people could transmit the virus before showing symptoms, these authorities began reconsidering their stance on mask usage for the general public [0]. Recent guidance from health officials, such as South Africa's health minister Dr. Zweli Mkhize, now recommends that everyone should wear face masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, especially in situations where physical distancing is difficult, such as on crowded public transport or in queues at shops [0]. The Western Cape provincial government has also advised ordinary citizens to use non-medical cloth masks when out in public, acknowledging the shortage of medical masks and the need to reserve them for healthcare workers [0]. Experts note that while cloth masks may not provide the same level of protection as medical masks, they can help by capturing droplet particles expelled when speaking, sneezing, or coughing, thereby reducing the risk of spreading the virus to others [0]. The primary benefit of wearing a mask is to protect those around the wearer, rather than to provide personal protection [0]. However, it is important to use masks correctly, as improper use can increase the risk of infection, for example, by causing people to touch their faces more frequently [0]. Masks should not be considered a substitute for other preventive measures such as hand-washing, maintaining physical distance, and staying home when ill [0].

However, wearing a cloth mask is not guaranteed to prevent you from contracting COVID-19, and it is important to continue practicing physical distancing (staying at least 6 feet from others) even while wearing a mask [0]. The primary purpose of wearing a cloth mask is to contain your respiratory secretions, which may contain the virus, and prevent them from spreading to others, especially since studies show a significant portion of individuals infected with COVID-19 do not show symptoms and can transmit the virus before showing symptoms [0]. Additionally, wearing a mask can help prevent you from touching your nose and mouth, where the virus can easily be spread [0].

According to Dr. DaCosta Aboagye, the Director of Health Promotion at the Ghana Health Service, the use of face masks—particularly Ghana-made masks that meet approved standards and are certified by the Food and Drugs Authority—can reduce the risk of transmitting the virus in confined spaces such as workplaces, buses, and shops [0]. Masks are especially important because many people may have asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infections, and wearing a mask can prevent droplets that carry the virus from escaping and infecting others [0]. However, Dr. Aboagye emphasizes that masks only provide minimal protection on their own and should not be seen as a replacement for frequent handwashing with soap and water or the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers [0]. The effectiveness of masks depends on their proper use, including washing or sanitizing hands before and after wearing, ensuring a tight fit, avoiding touching the mask or face, and washing reusable masks daily [0]. Wrongful use, such as touching the mask frequently or wearing it incorrectly, can increase vulnerability and defeat the purpose of wearing a mask [0]. There are different types of masks, including disposable surgical masks, N95 respirators, and cloth masks made from local fabrics. N95 masks provide a higher degree of protection by blocking at least 95% of airborne particles if worn properly, but they are more expensive and less available to the general public [0]. Cloth masks, when used correctly, are beneficial because they are affordable, can be made from household items, and help protect the community by reducing stigma and preventing the spread from asymptomatic individuals [0].

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare initially advised that only those who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms or those caring for COVID-19 patients should wear masks, citing concerns about mask shortages and the need to use masks wisely [0]. However, this guidance has been challenged by various researchers and scientific advisers due to the high percentage of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, who can transmit the virus without knowing they are infected [0]. Studies have shown that up to 25% of COVID-19 patients could be asymptomatic, and in some cases, such as in Iceland, up to 50% of those who tested positive showed no symptoms [0]. This means that many people who are capable of spreading the virus may not realize they are infected, making it difficult to identify who should wear a mask based solely on symptoms [0]. Because of this, some experts, including the principal scientific adviser to the Government of India, recommend the wider use of masks by the general public as an effective measure to reduce transmission [0]. The principal scientific adviser’s manual suggests that if 50% of the population wears masks, only 50% of the population would be infected, and if 80% wear masks, the outbreak could be stopped immediately [0]. Masks help prevent viruses from coming out of the mouth and nose during coughing and sneezing and also reduce the likelihood of fingers picking up pathogens from the face and spreading them to others or to surfaces [0]. While wearing a mask is not a guarantee against COVID-19 infection, it does significantly reduce the chances of transmission, especially when combined with other measures such as social distancing [0].

For health-care workers, fit-tested N95 masks are recommended because they provide the ""best protection"" against coronavirus by creating an airtight seal around the nose and mouth, preventing even the smallest airborne particles from being inhaled or making contact with the wearer’s respiratory system. This recommendation is made out of an abundance of caution, especially when conducting clinical examinations or collecting tests from individuals suspected of having COVID-19, and is based on the precautionary principle until more is known about the virus’s transmission. However, evidence shows that COVID-19 is primarily spread by respiratory droplets rather than airborne particles, so a procedural or surgical mask, along with eye protection and protective clothing, may also be adequate in some situations for health-care workers, though this has not been fully proven yet [0]. For the general public, masks are not generally recommended unless the individual is showing respiratory symptoms or is caring for someone with COVID-19 symptoms. The risk of transmission in the general public is considered low, and masks are primarily advised for those who are sick to prevent them from exposing others to respiratory viruses through coughing and sneezing. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes that wearing a medical mask is one of several prevention measures to limit the spread of respiratory diseases, including COVID-19, in affected areas. However, the effectiveness of masks depends on strict adherence to infection control principles, such as changing masks frequently, discarding them properly, and avoiding touching the mask while in use, as improper use can increase the risk of transmission by contaminating the hands and subsequently the face [0]. It is also important to note that cloth masks, such as those made from cotton or gauze, are not recommended under any circumstance. Proper mask protocol includes cleaning hands before putting on a mask, ensuring the mask covers the nose, mouth, and chin with no gaps, avoiding touching the mask while wearing it, replacing damp masks, and discarding single-use masks immediately after use. Even health-care workers do not wear masks continuously, but only when in contact with patients showing respiratory symptoms [0]. In summary, masks can help prevent COVID-19 transmission, especially when used correctly by health-care workers and symptomatic individuals, but they are not generally recommended for healthy members of the public unless they are caring for someone with symptoms.

Experts caution that a rush to reopen and abandon social distancing could lead to a resurgence of cases and undo the progress achieved [0].

Health workers and government departments around the world have encouraged people to maintain physical distance from others outside their homes as a non-pharmaceutical preventive measure [0]. A video shared by the Ohio Department of Public Health visually demonstrated the effectiveness of social distancing using mouse traps and ping pong balls: when the traps were close together, a single ping pong ball triggered a chain reaction, symbolizing rapid disease spread; when the traps were spaced apart, the chain reaction was prevented, illustrating how social distancing can break the chain of transmission and prevent the spread of the disease [0].

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has expressed concern about the spread of the virus through close contact, which is defined as being within about 6 feet of an infected person for a prolonged period of time, such as while sharing a room or being coughed on by a patient [0]. By increasing the distance between individuals, social distancing reduces the likelihood of such close contact and, therefore, the risk of transmission. Many governments and health authorities have implemented social distancing guidelines and restrictions to help stem the spread of COVID-19. For example, the District of Columbia instructed restaurants, bars, and nightclubs to move tables farther apart and limit table seating to six persons or fewer, with occupied tables and booths separated by at least 6 feet (1.83 meters) [0]. Similarly, Ireland decided to close all pubs and bars for two weeks after recognizing the difficulty of maintaining social distancing in such venues [0]. These measures are based on the understanding that limiting close interactions between people can significantly reduce the spread of the virus. Additionally, health experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have emphasized the importance of social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19, especially in crowded places like airports, where long lines and crowding can increase the risk of transmission [0]. The chief of the World Health Organization has also noted that even elbow bumps, which bring people closer together, may not be advisable during the pandemic [0]. In summary, social distancing is a key strategy in preventing the spread of COVID-19 by minimizing close contact between individuals, which is the primary way the virus is transmitted [0].",helpful,['doc_05d8bd45-7252-4a5b-98ca-b0a4a2c9b5df.md'],neutral_helpful_qid_15_doc_05d8bd45-7252-4a5b-98ca-b0a4a2c9b5df.md,doc_05d8bd45-7252-4a5b-98ca-b0a4a2c9b5df.md,helpful

It is important to note that most of the UV radiation from sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface is UVA, which is less effective at inactivating viruses, while UVC, the most effective type for sterilization, is completely filtered out by the atmosphere and does not reach the ground [0]. Laboratory studies on SARS, a close relative of the new coronavirus, found that UVA had no effect on the virus, while UVC could inactivate it within 15 minutes, but UVC is not present in natural sunlight [0]. Furthermore, even if sunlight or UV light can reduce the presence of the virus on surfaces outdoors, this does not translate to effective prevention of COVID-19 in people, as infection is more likely to occur indoors or through direct person-to-person transmission before UV rays can inactivate viral droplets [0]. Additionally, using UV light to treat patients already infected with the virus is not supported by scientific evidence and is not considered safe or effective [0].

A scientific study supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China found that high temperature and high relative humidity significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19, even after accounting for factors such as population density and GDP per capita of cities [0]. The study observed that countries with lower air temperature and humidity, such as Korea, Japan, and Iran, experienced more severe outbreaks compared to warmer and more humid countries like Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand [0]. The researchers explained that viruses like influenza, which is also a coronavirus, are more stable in cold temperatures, and respiratory droplets remain airborne longer in dry air. Cold and dry weather can also weaken the host's immunity, making people more susceptible to infection. These mechanisms are likely to apply to COVID-19 as well, and the study's results are consistent with evidence that high temperature and high humidity reduce the viability of the SARS coronavirus, a close relative of COVID-19 [0]. The study concluded that the arrival of summer and the rainy season in the northern hemisphere could effectively reduce the transmission of COVID-19. For example, in Tokyo, with typical summer temperatures of 28°C and 85% relative humidity, the transmission of COVID-19 would be seriously reduced [0]. However, the study also noted that risks remain in some countries in the southern hemisphere, such as Australia and South Africa, during their winter months [0].

According to Dr. Donald Boyd, an oncologist, hematologist, and nutritionist at Yale Medicine, people should avoid herbal products like Echinacea because there are controversial studies about the product having a negative impact on the immune response and its possibility of interacting with other medications [0].
