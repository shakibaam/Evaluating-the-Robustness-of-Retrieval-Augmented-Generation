qid_13,helpful-helpful,neutral,,Masks COVID-19,Can wearing masks prevent COVID-19?,"Wearing masks can help prevent the spread of COVID-19, but the effectiveness and recommendations for mask use vary depending on the context and the type of mask used. COVID-19 primarily spreads through respiratory droplets that are expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and these droplets can infect others either directly or by contaminating surfaces that are then touched by others who subsequently touch their face [0, 1]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and various health ministries, masks are primarily recommended for individuals who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms or those caring for someone who may have COVID-19 [0, 1]. This is because masks can help prevent sick individuals from spreading the virus to others by trapping respiratory droplets [0, 1]. For the general public, especially those who are not showing symptoms, the advisories have been more cautious, often citing concerns about mask shortages and the importance of using masks wisely [0, 1]. However, there is a significant concern regarding asymptomatic transmission, as studies have found that a substantial percentage of COVID-19 patients may not show symptoms but can still spread the virus [0]. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States has estimated that up to 25% of COVID-19 patients could be asymptomatic, and studies from China and Iceland have suggested that asymptomatic individuals may account for a large portion of transmission [0]. Because of this, some experts and countries have advocated for broader mask usage among the general public to reduce the risk of unknowingly spreading the virus [0]. Homemade masks or improvised cotton masks are suggested for the general public, as medical-grade masks such as N95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers who are at higher risk due to their close contact with COVID-19 patients [0, 1]. N95 masks, when properly fit-tested and used according to infection control protocols, provide the highest level of protection against airborne particles and are recommended for healthcare professionals conducting clinical examinations or collecting samples from suspected COVID-19 patients [1]. For the general public, procedural or surgical masks, or even homemade masks, can reduce the risk of transmission, especially in situations where social distancing is difficult to maintain [0]. It is important to note that wearing a mask is not a guarantee against infection, but it does reduce the chances of both spreading and contracting the virus, particularly when combined with other preventive measures such as hand hygiene and social distancing [0, 1]. Proper use and disposal of masks are essential to ensure their effectiveness and to avoid increasing the risk of transmission through contaminated masks [1]. In summary, wearing masks can help prevent COVID-19, especially by reducing the spread from asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, but their effectiveness depends on proper usage, the type of mask, and adherence to other preventive measures [0, 1].",helpful,"['helpful_documents/doc_ced03280-a800-4091-90cf-a477b42af1c2.md', 'helpful_documents/doc_51aa5d46-f3ce-4cf3-9eff-1fca6d80208c.md']",neutral_helpful-helpful_qid_13_0,helpful

Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Public Health Agency of Canada recommend that people wear non-medical masks in public settings where physical distancing is difficult, such as grocery stores or public transit, as an additional measure to protect those around them [0, 1]. However, wearing a mask should be seen as a complement to, not a substitute for, other preventive measures such as social distancing, frequent handwashing, and disinfecting high-touch surfaces [0, 1].

The claim that 5G technology is responsible for the spread or cause of COVID-19 is a conspiracy theory that is not supported by any scientific evidence [0, 1]. According to the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNRP), the main effect that radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF EMFs) emitted by 5G base stations have on the human body is a slight increase in the temperature of exposed tissue, but these energy levels are far too low to affect the immune system or cause any disease, including COVID-19 [0]. Furthermore, 5G uses non-ionizing radiation, which is a low-strength form of electromagnetic wave that does not have the capability to break down atomic or cellular structures, unlike ionizing radiation, which is dangerous and can cause biological harm [1]. Millimeter wave (mmWave), a component of 5G, is actually weaker than traditional 3G and 4G transmissions and cannot even penetrate the inner layer of human skin, making it incapable of causing any viral infection [1]. Scientific organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have confirmed that COVID-19 is caused by a virus (SARS-CoV-2) that originated from animals, not from any form of wireless technology or radiation [1]. Therefore, there is no scientific or logical basis to support the idea that 5G antennas can cause COVID-19 [0, 1].",unhelpful,"['helpful_documents/doc_9bbe189a-cd19-4c5e-a1dc-57f4edc582c7.md', 'helpful_documents/doc_fd4dc76a-c9c5-4f72-9b09-14ce56a5ea73.md']",neutral_helpful-helpful_qid_7_0,unhelpful

Furthermore, the protein shell of the coronavirus cannot interact with 5G radio signals, as viruses and electromagnetic radiation exist in entirely different forms and do not interact with each other [0]. Despite these facts, conspiracy theories linking 5G to COVID-19 have circulated widely on social media, leading to misinformation and even acts of vandalism against telecommunications infrastructure [0, 1].
