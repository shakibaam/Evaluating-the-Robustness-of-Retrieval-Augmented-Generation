qid_15,Social Distancing COVID-19,My doctor told me that social distancing can prevent COVID-19. Can you give me more information on how it works?,consistent,"Social distancing prevents COVID-19 transmission by reducing close contact between people, which interrupts the virus's primary spread mechanism. SARS-CoV-2 primarily transmits through respiratory droplets and aerosols expelled when infected individuals speak, cough, sneeze, or breathe.

When people maintain physical distance (typically 6 feet/2 meters), these infectious droplets are less likely to travel between individuals. Droplets containing viral particles can quickly fall to surfaces or disperse before reaching another person, significantly reducing infection risk.

Key transmission prevention mechanisms include:
- Minimizing respiratory droplet transfer
- Reducing potential exposure time
- Limiting close personal interactions
- Decreasing probability of viral particle inhalation

Effectiveness depends on multiple factors:
