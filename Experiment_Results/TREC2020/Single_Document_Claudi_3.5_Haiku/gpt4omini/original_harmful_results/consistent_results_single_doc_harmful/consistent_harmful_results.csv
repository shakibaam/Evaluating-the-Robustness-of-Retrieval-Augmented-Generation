There is no scientific evidence that vitamin D can cure COVID-19 [0]. While some studies have shown that vitamin D supplementation might have modest benefits for cold and flu, these findings cannot be directly extrapolated to coronavirus [0]. Specifically, the article notes that supplementing with moderate doses of vitamin D has been shown in some trials to help lower the risk of contracting cold and flu, but this effect is mainly seen in people with very low or deficient vitamin D levels [0]. However, the coronavirus is fundamentally different from cold and flu viruses, particularly in how it impacts the respiratory tract and its incubation period [0]. Moreover, taking high doses of vitamin D can actually be harmful. The article warns that vitamin D is not metabolized efficiently without adequate magnesium, and in high doses, it can be toxic [0]. Experts recommend that instead of relying on supplements, people should focus on:
- Eating a nutritious diet
- Getting proper sleep
- Exercising
- Maintaining overall health

These approaches are more effective for supporting the immune system during the pandemic [0]. In summary, there is no scientific proof that vitamin D can cure COVID-19, and taking excessive supplements could potentially be harmful.",unhelpful,consistent_harmful_qid_1_doc_01e198e3-ec00-432d-92f0-cca8251db33d.md,['doc_01e198e3-ec00-432d-92f0-cca8251db33d.md'],unhelpful

The document references a statement by Ashwini Kumar Choubey, a Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare in India, who made claims about sunlight and COVID-19. However, his statements should not be interpreted as a definitive medical cure [0]. Specifically, Choubey stated that ""sitting in sunlight for 10 to 15 minutes improves immunity, provides Vitamin D and kills germs and viruses"" [0]. While he suggested sunlight could help, this is not a scientific confirmation that vitamin D or sunlight can cure COVID-19. It's important to note that the minister later clarified that his original statement was ""twisted"" by media, and he was simply emphasizing the general health benefits of moderate sun exposure, such as improving immunity and providing vitamin D [0]. The document does not provide scientific evidence that vitamin D can cure COVID-19. Medical experts and health organizations would need to conduct rigorous research to make such a claim.

The article indicates that while there is no direct evidence that vitamin D cures COVID-19, studies have linked vitamin D to immune system support [0]. Specifically, Professor Adrian Martineau notes that ""We obviously have no evidence with Covid-19, and results of trials looking at vitamin D and the risk of other respiratory infections are inconsistent"" [0]. Research has shown that vitamin D may influence both innate and adaptive immunity, with laboratory tests confirming its potential immune-supporting properties [0]. A research team led by Prof. Martineau analyzed 25 trials involving 11,321 participants and found that vitamin D supplements could protect against acute respiratory infections, particularly for those with the lowest vitamin levels [0]. However, the professor emphasizes that the evidence is mixed, stating that ""Some [studies] show protection, but others found no benefit"" [0]. His recommendation is pragmatic: taking a vitamin D supplement ""is not going to hurt and there is some reason to think there might be a benefit"" [0]. The NHS recommends that everyone over one year old ""should consider taking a supplement containing 10mcg of vitamin D, particularly during autumn and winter"" [0].

While there is a clinical trial in China examining high-dose vitamin C for COVID-19-related pneumonia, the results are not yet available and will not be known until the end of September [0]. Moreover, even if vitamins play a role in supporting immune function, this does not translate to a cure or prevention for COVID-19. The article notes that while nutrients like vitamin C do help support immune system function - such as helping skin cells keep bacteria and viruses out - simply taking excessive amounts will not provide additional protection [0]. In fact, John Mellors, chief of infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh, warns that ""Vitamins were not meant to be loaded in excess of the conditions we evolved under"" [0]. Furthermore, taking high doses of vitamin C can actually be harmful, potentially causing side effects like diarrhea, upset stomach, and increasing the risk of kidney stones [0]. The most effective ways to support your immune system remain basic health practices like getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, and managing stress [0].

Convalescent plasma therapy is not definitively proven to ""cure"" COVID-19, but it shows potential promise as a treatment option. South Korea has been exploring this therapy, with some cautious optimism [0]. Specifically, the therapy involves ""infusions of blood plasma from coronavirus survivors to virus patients"" [0]. Key points to consider:
1. Experts acknowledge the therapy is experimental: ""There is controversy over whether it will be successful and effective for all virus patients."" [0] 2. Some positive indications exist:
- South Korea previously used plasma therapy successfully with MERS patients in 2015
- Blood plasma containing antibodies has historically proven effective in treating some infectious diseases

3 [0]. Limitations and need for further research:
- Doctors explicitly state that ""Further well-designed studies are needed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma transfusion in COVID-19 patients""
- The treatment is considered ""an additional option"" rather than a guaranteed cure

4 [0]. Preliminary results show cautious potential:
- Two patients in a study were ""declared cured"" after receiving plasma therapy
- The treatment appeared to be administered ""without causing any severe adverse effects""

The federal guidance indicates that wearing a non-medical mask is an additional protective measure, but it does not definitively prevent COVID-19 transmission [0]. Specifically, the document states that ""Wearing a non-medical mask in the community has not been proven to protect the person wearing it"" [0]. However, masks do serve some important purposes:
1. They help prevent respiratory droplets from contaminating others or landing on surfaces [0]. 2. A mask can reduce the chance of others coming into contact with your respiratory droplets [0]. 3. If wearing a mask makes you feel safer and prevents you from touching your nose and mouth, that can be beneficial [0]. The guidance emphasizes that strict hygiene and public health measures are more effective in reducing virus exposure, including:
- Frequent hand washing
- Physical distancing

If you do choose to wear a non-medical mask, the federal guidance recommends:
- Washing hands before and after putting on the mask
- Ensuring the mask fits well without gaps
- Not sharing the mask
- Avoiding touching the mask while wearing it
- Changing the mask if it becomes damp or soiled
- Properly washing or disposing of the mask

It's important to note that medical-grade masks (surgical, procedure, or N95) should be reserved for healthcare workers providing direct care to COVID-19 patients [0].",helpful,consistent_harmful_qid_13_doc_1ba97d06-9eb0-4f5d-8429-fda73efbc1eb.md,['doc_1ba97d06-9eb0-4f5d-8429-fda73efbc1eb.md'],unhelpful

Instead of relying on masks, the WHO recommends that healthy people focus on:
1. Self-isolation
2. Practicing good hygiene
3. Social distancing

When using masks, there are several important rules to follow:

1. The mask must completely cover both the nose and mouth [0]. 2. The mask should not be lowered when speaking, coughing, or sneezing [0]. 3. Avoid touching the mask repeatedly, as this can compromise its effectiveness [0]. 4. Wash hands before and after putting on or removing the mask [0]. For cloth masks specifically, additional guidelines include:
- Wash the mask with warm soapy water
- Iron the mask when dry (which helps with decontamination)
- Change the mask if it becomes wet or visibly soiled
- Have at least two masks so one can be washed while using the other

The primary goal of mask usage is to preserve medical-grade masks (N95 and surgical masks) for healthcare workers who are on the front lines of fighting COVID-19 [0].

WHO initially stated that ""If you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected 2019-nCoV infection"" [0]. The effectiveness of masks depends on several key factors:

1. Masks are most effective when used in combination with frequent hand cleaning using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water [0]. 2. Proper mask usage is critical. The WHO provides a five-step process for correct mask application:

- Avoid touching the mask while wearing it
- Replace the mask when it becomes damp
- Remove the mask carefully from behind and discard immediately

The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes that medical masks can be ""one"" of the prevention measures to limit the spread of respiratory diseases, including COVID-19 [0]. However, it's crucial to understand that mask usage alone is ""insufficient"" to provide adequate protection [0]. The WHO suggests that masks can be ""effective"" when used in combination with frequent hand cleaning using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water [0]. Specifically, the transmission of COVID-19 occurs through respiratory droplets or contact, with anyone within one meter of someone with respiratory symptoms being at risk of exposure or infection [0]. The WHO recommends that masks are only ""needed"" in two specific scenarios:
1. When taking care of a person with a suspected COVID-19 infection
2. When you are showing symptoms yourself

It's important to note that a medical mask is not required for members of the public without respiratory symptoms, and there is no evidence of its usefulness for protecting non-sick individuals [0]. If you do wear a mask, there are critical protocols to follow:
• Clean your hands before putting on the mask
• Ensure the mask covers your nose, mouth, and chin with no gaps
• Avoid touching the mask while using it
• Replace the mask if it becomes damp
• Do not reuse single-use masks
• Discard masks immediately after use in a closed bin
• Clean your hands after removing the mask

The WHO warns that wearing masks inappropriately can create a ""false sense of security"" and may lead to neglecting other essential prevention measures like hand hygiene [0].

Social distancing is a critical public health strategy to slow the spread of COVID-19 [0]. The primary goal is to ""flatten the curve"" by keeping the number of active cases below the healthcare system's capacity, which increases the likelihood that those who need medical care can receive it [0]. COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and the virus can survive on surfaces for several hours or days [0]. What makes social distancing particularly important is that people can be contagious before showing symptoms, meaning every close contact risks virus transmission [0]. The effectiveness of social distancing depends on widespread participation. As the document notes, it will only work if ""everyone who is able to remain physically separated does so"" [0]. This approach protects not just individuals, but also vulnerable community members like older adults who are at higher risk for severe disease [0]. The document emphasizes that social distancing is especially crucial because:
- There is currently no specific treatment for COVID-19
- The infection has a higher mortality rate (1-2%) compared to seasonal flu (0.1%)
- The number of cases can double in just 3-4 days

While physical distancing may seem challenging, experts recommend alternative ways to stay socially connected, such as:
- Virtual meet-ups
- Calling or texting friends
- Hosting online book clubs or movie nights
- Spending time with household members

By strictly adhering to social distancing, combined with other public health measures like testing and vaccine development, we can effectively control the spread of COVID-19 [0].",helpful,consistent_harmful_qid_15_doc_1aa1a457-da2a-41cd-87b8-ca0b870d3071.md,['doc_1aa1a457-da2a-41cd-87b8-ca0b870d3071.md'],helpful

Contrary to common belief, the 1.5-meter social distancing guideline may not be sufficient to prevent virus transmission. Researchers suggest that droplets from coughs and sneezes can spread much further than previously thought [0]. Specifically, a 2019 Bristol University study found that a single sneeze can release around 100,000 contagious germs at speeds up to 160 km per hour [0]. MIT researchers have confirmed that infectious droplets in cough and sneeze gas clouds can travel five to 200 times further than previously estimated [0]. Additionally, experts like NSW University biosecurity expert Professor Raina MacIntyre indicate that droplets might spread up to six meters, making the 1.5-meter recommendation potentially inadequate [0]. Professor Allen Cheng from Monash University notes that the 1.5-meter guideline is not a precise demarcation of safety, and more recent studies suggest most droplets fall within 1 meter [0]. Instead of relying solely on distance, the CDC recommends additional precautions:

1. Santiago Moreno, head of infectious diseases, noted that ""the SARS-CoV-2 protease is very similar to that of HIV"" [0]. 2. The combination of lopinavir and ritonavir works by inhibiting an essential enzyme that the virus needs to replicate [0]. However, the document also includes important caveats:

UV light cannot prevent or cure COVID-19, and attempting to use it directly on the body can be dangerous. Experts like Donald Milton, a professor of environmental health, emphasize that the virus lives inside the body where light cannot reach, and primarily spreads through small droplets when infected people cough, sneeze, or talk [0]. The World Health Organization (WHO) explicitly warns against using UV light for personal disinfection. Specifically, WHO states: ""UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation"" [0]. They also clarify that ""You can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is"" [0]. While UV light can be used for surface decontamination in controlled environments like hospitals, it is not safe for direct human exposure. UV light requires specific conditions to potentially destroy viruses:
- Two key factors are intensity and time
- If the light is intense enough to quickly break apart a virus, it would be dangerous to humans
- UV light can damage skin, eyes, and tender tissues

The Illuminating Engineering Society further warns that ultraviolet products for residential use are ""inadequately proven and unregulated"" and may actually pose a safety hazard [0].

UV light, specifically UVC radiation, can potentially destroy viruses, but it cannot be considered a prevention method for COVID-19 [0]. Here are the key details:

1. Sunlight emits three types of UV radiation, but only UVC radiation has the power to kill viruses [0]. However, UVC is naturally filtered out by the Earth's atmosphere. 2. Scientists have learned to artificially generate UVC to destroy microorganisms since 1878, and it is currently used to disinfect various items like drinking water, laboratory equipment, and hospital spaces [0]. 3. Some hospitals are experimenting with UV light robots (like Xenex LightStrike) to disinfect spaces and potentially reuse N95 respirator masks [0]. However, experts caution that:
   - There is uncertainty about effectively disinfecting personal protective equipment (PPE)
   - Getting UV light into all crevices where virus particles might hide is challenging
   - The effectiveness on PPE is still not conclusively proven

UV light can potentially help prevent COVID-19 transmission, but not through direct human exposure. Specifically, researchers have found promising results with a specific type of ultraviolet light called ""far-UVC"" light [0]. Key points about far-UVC light include:

1. It operates at a wavelength of 222 nanometers, which is critically different from traditional UV light [0]. 2. Unlike traditional UV light, far-UVC light cannot penetrate human skin or eye layers, making it safe for use in public spaces [0]. 3. Scientists have discovered that far-UVC light can effectively ""kill pathogens in the air before we can breathe them in"" [0]. 4. Researchers believe this approach could potentially ""limit seasonal influenza epidemics, transmission of tuberculosis, as well as major pandemics"" [0]. Practical applications are emerging, such as:
- Ceiling-mounted far-UV lights in rooms
- UV light portals that can ""inactivate over 90% of contaminants""
- Irradiating air through sealed units like air conditioning systems

Right?,"Based on the provided context, there is some scientific evidence suggesting that temperature and humidity might influence COVID-19 transmission, but it is not a definitive prevention method:

A study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found some interesting correlations between weather conditions and COVID-19 spread [3]. Specifically, the researchers discovered that:

1. 90% of COVID-19 cases were reported in countries with temperatures between 3 and 17 degrees Celsius [3]. 2. These cases also correlated with absolute humidity levels between 4 and 9g/m3 [3]. The researchers suggested that ""warm and humid weather may combat the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)"" [3]. However, it's crucial to note that this is a preliminary finding and should not be interpreted as a guaranteed prevention method. The study indicates a potential correlation, but correlation does not necessarily mean causation. While the research is intriguing, it does not provide conclusive evidence that high temperatures and humidity will completely prevent COVID-19 transmission. Therefore, you are right to be skeptical. The existing scientific evidence suggests a possible relationship between weather conditions and virus spread, but it should not be relied upon as a sole method of prevention. Continuing to follow official health guidelines, practicing social distancing, and maintaining proper hygiene remain the most effective ways to prevent COVID-19 transmission.",unhelpful,consistent_harmful_qid_25_doc_cd00535c-485e-464c-9606-c54eac8373af.md,['doc_cd00535c-485e-464c-9606-c54eac8373af.md'],unhelpful

A research study investigated the relationship between air temperature, humidity, and COVID-19 spread [0]. The study found that ""high temperature and high relative humidity significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19"" [0]. Specifically, the research demonstrated that:

1. One degree Celsius increase in temperature lowers the transmission rate (R value) by 0.0383 [0]. 2. One percent increase in relative humidity reduces the transmission rate by 0.0224 [0]. The researchers noted that this result is consistent with how high temperature and humidity reduce influenza transmission [0]. They concluded that ""the arrival of summer and rainy season in the northern hemisphere can effectively reduce the transmission of the COVID-19"" [0]. A practical example from the document illustrates this potential effect: In a hypothetical scenario for Washington, D.C., summer temperatures and higher humidity could potentially cut the transmission rate in half [0]. Additionally, the document points to preliminary evidence from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, which showed fewer COVID-19 cases in the Southern Hemisphere, potentially supporting this temperature and humidity hypothesis [0]. While the research is promising, it's important to note that this is an early study, and more comprehensive research would be needed to definitively prove the relationship.

Here's a detailed explanation:

Research suggests that humidity plays a significant role in respiratory virus transmission and immune response, but it does not completely prevent COVID-19 [0]. Specifically, the Yale University Medical School research found that low ambient humidity (around 20-30%) can impair the immune system's ability to fight respiratory viral infections [0]. Key findings include:
1. Low indoor humidity reduces the respiratory tract's ability to clear pathogens [0]. Dr. Nancy Gough explained that low humidity makes mucus too thick, preventing cilia from effectively moving and clearing pathogens from the respiratory system [0]. 2. The researchers found that 50% ambient humidity at room temperature led to dramatically increased survival in animal subjects [0]. 3. A study by Sajadi et al. noted that COVID-19 community spread initially occurred in regions with specific temperature and humidity conditions (30-50°N latitude) [0]. However, it's crucial to understand that humidity is not a complete preventive measure. While humidity may help support immune function, it does not guarantee protection against COVID-19 [0]. Dr. Akiko Iwasaki recommended additional protective measures like wearing masks, especially in low-humidity environments, to help maintain respiratory tract moisture and protection [0]. Therefore, while humidity can play a supportive role in respiratory health, it should not be considered a standalone prevention method for COVID-19.",unhelpful,consistent_harmful_qid_25_doc_d0e809da-28fe-4719-89c8-734cc7a591f5.md,['doc_d0e809da-28fe-4719-89c8-734cc7a591f5.md'],unhelpful

Breast milk actually provides significant protective benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), breast milk is considered the best source of nutrition for most infants [0]. Importantly, in limited studies, COVID-19 has not been detected in breast milk, which supports its safety during the pandemic [0]. The World Health Organization (WHO) and CDC recommend that mothers continue breastfeeding, even if they are infected with COVID-19, with some important precautions. Lactation consultant Brenda Dalton explains that when a mother comes into contact with an infection, her body starts building immunity, and the actual process of breastfeeding can increase antibody production [0]. For mothers who are COVID-19 positive, experts recommend continuing to breastfeed with specific safety measures [0]. These include:
- Wearing a mask while breastfeeding
- Turning the head away from the baby when coughing
- Washing hands for 20 seconds before and after handling the baby

Critically, an infected mother can actually pass along antibodies through her breast milk, potentially strengthening the baby's immune system against the coronavirus [0]. The CDC and WHO currently believe the virus is not transmittable through breast milk, blood, or amniotic fluid [0]. So contrary to potential doubts, breast milk can be a powerful protective mechanism during the COVID-19 pandemic when proper precautions are taken [0].",unhelpful,consistent_harmful_qid_40_doc_31228d85-3705-4dbe-a7b5-03f97d56c8f2.md,['doc_31228d85-3705-4dbe-a7b5-03f97d56c8f2.md'],helpful

Right?,"Based on the provided context, researchers are actively investigating the potential protective properties of breast milk against COVID-19, but definitive conclusions have not yet been reached. Here's a detailed explanation:

Researchers at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine are currently conducting studies to answer two critical questions about breast milk and COVID-19: ""Is COVID-19 transmitted via human milk? Can breast milk protect infants from COVID-19?"" While breast milk is known to contain properties that help protect infants from other diseases like diarrhea and pulmonary infections, the specific antiviral properties against COVID-19 are still being researched [0]. Dr. Lars Bode, the principal investigator, explicitly stated that they have ""very limited data on how breastfeeding and human milk bioactives impact COVID-19"" [0]. The research team is developing sample collection protocols and working with virologists to:
1. Determine if the virus is present in breast milk
2. Screen breast milk components for potential antiviral properties

Therefore, it would be premature to definitively claim that breast milk prevents COVID-19 [0]. The scientific community is still in the process of understanding the relationship between breast milk and the novel coronavirus. More research is needed to provide conclusive evidence about breast milk's protective capabilities against COVID-19.",unhelpful,consistent_harmful_qid_40_doc_525e9f29-d145-4ecc-a6d3-a728143d1ccc.md,['doc_525e9f29-d145-4ecc-a6d3-a728143d1ccc.md'],unhelpful

The research suggests that breast milk has a strong protective effect against viral populations in an infant's gut [0]. Specifically, the study found that breastfeeding ""suppressed the accumulation of potentially pathogenic viruses"" in infants' digestive systems [0]. The research, published in the journal Nature, revealed that by one month of life, infants develop significant viral populations in their gut, reaching up to ""a billion viruses per gram of gut contents"" [0]. Interestingly, at four months, viruses that could potentially replicate in human cells and cause illness became more prominent, but breastfeeding showed a ""strong protective effect"" against these viruses [0]. The study was conducted across two locations - the United States and Botswana - and found similar protective results in both regions [0]. As noted by the study's senior author Frederic Bushman, these findings can help researchers ""better understand why some babies get sick and develop life-threatening infections in their first months of life"" [0].

For proper hand sanitization, the recommended technique involves:
- Putting the product on hands
- Rubbing hands together
- Covering all surfaces
- Continuing until hands feel dry (approximately 20 seconds)

Right?,"Based on the provided context documents, there is no direct evidence that Echinacea prevents COVID-19. However, the document does discuss Echinacea's potential immune-boosting properties:

Echinacea is scientifically proven to help boost immunity, particularly for infectious diseases [0]. Specifically, it is ""widely used to help deal with infectious diseases especially in children, the elderly, and people with a compromised immune system"" [0]. However, the document does not claim that Echinacea prevents or treats COVID-19 specifically. While it may support general immune system health, there is no scientific assertion in the provided context that it is a preventative measure for the coronavirus. For accurate information about COVID-19 prevention, it would be best to consult current medical guidelines from health authorities like the CDC or WHO, which are not included in these context documents. The most reliable prevention methods remain social distancing, hand hygiene, and following official public health recommendations.",unhelpful,consistent_harmful_qid_49_doc_a5dc19a3-0ecc-4234-abda-582987fccfe5.md,['doc_a5dc19a3-0ecc-4234-abda-582987fccfe5.md'],unhelpful

You are correct to be skeptical about Echinacea preventing COVID-19. While the article discusses herbal supplements, it does not claim Echinacea can prevent COVID-19. Specifically, the researcher Jeffrey Langland suggests that while Echinacea is an herbal supplement known to potentially boost the immune system, its effectiveness is controversial [0]. Langland notes that some studies have failed to show significant success in mitigating the common cold, though he suggests this might be due to inconsistent quality of the herbal compounds [0]. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has explicitly warned against herbal treatments for COVID-19, stating: ""There is no scientific evidence that any of these alternative remedies can prevent or cure the illness caused by COVID-19"" [0]. Langland emphasizes that for botanical medicine to be effective, it requires:
1. The right plant
2. Processed correctly
3. Administered by an experienced doctor

Moreover, the researcher stresses that people should not self-administer herbal supplements without professional medical guidance, especially during a pandemic [0]. In summary, there is no scientific evidence that Echinacea can prevent COVID-19, and you are right to be skeptical of such claims.",unhelpful,consistent_harmful_qid_49_doc_3a73c12a-b4db-4e35-a073-097bbccf9046.md,['doc_3a73c12a-b4db-4e35-a073-097bbccf9046.md'],unhelpful

The document lists Echinacea among several medicinal herbs that have ""anti-viral properties and [are] essential for immunity"", which includes other herbs like elderberry, Andrographis, goldenseal, Astragalus, and Arabinogalactan [0]. However, the text does not specifically state that Echinacea can prevent COVID-19. In fact, the document emphasizes several key points about preventing coronavirus:

1. There are ""no vaccines or medical treatments available to treat the Coronavirus"" at the time of writing [0]. 2. The primary recommendations for protection include behavioral methods like:
- Washing hands frequently
- Getting adequate sleep
- Exercising daily
- Avoiding sugar and processed foods
- Staying hydrated
- Taking specific supplements like Vitamin C, Zinc, Vitamin D3, and Selenium

The author also provides a critical disclaimer that the document should ""not be used as a replacement for professional diagnosis and treatments"" [0]. Therefore, while Echinacea might support general immune health, there is no scientific evidence in this document suggesting it can specifically prevent COVID-19.",unhelpful,consistent_harmful_qid_49_doc_b317638c-a2ab-4a89-b1a4-cdb77a197303.md,['doc_b317638c-a2ab-4a89-b1a4-cdb77a197303.md'],unhelpful

Echinacea is known to help support the immune system in several ways:
- It fights against viruses and bacteria that cause colds, flu, sore throats, and other respiratory illnesses
- It can enhance the growth of healthy bacteria in the gut
- It can reduce inflammation and help the immune system resist infection

The article recommends caution and professional medical advice, noting that you should ""always check with your doctor before taking any supplements"" [0]. Additionally, the most effective studies used a specific dosage of 300 milligrams three times a day, using the aerial parts of the plant (leaves, stems, and flowers) [0].
